I don't want to over or under-state:\nAmerica is entering a disturbing new stage in the coronavirus\noutbreak. There has been community spread in at least one and likely two\nlocations in Washington State. And it appears the virus was being\ntransmitted for at least a few weeks before current cases were recognized.\nSo we can expect dozens or hundreds of cases in those locations unl ess\ncontact tracing is especially efficient.\nThat means the disease is loose and easily tran smitted.\nThe crucial issue now is the real mortality rate, which remains\nuncertain. The stated mortality is 2 percent. American experts are hoping\nthe rate turns out to be considerably lower. But the math remains tro ubling\nin any case. If only 5 percent of th e population eventually gets infected\n(which is on the low side of some estimates) and the mortality rat e is 1\nperc ent, th ere still would be a few hundred thou sand deaths.\nNIH-001034\nAt this stage, the main tool that public health experts have is social\ndistancing - the attempt to keep as many people as possible in affected\nareas out of sneezing distance from one another. This means measures such\nas closing schools, cancelling events in theaters and stadiums and\nencouraging employees to telework. States and localities ultimately make\nsuch decisions rather than the federal government. But according to some\nhealth experts I consulted, Washington State should be taking such\nmeasures right now. The effectiveness of social distancing is limit ed when\naction comes too late or ends too early.\nThe goal of such policies is to keep the Ro (reproduction ratio) as low\nas possible. When people are in close proximity, a single infected person\ncan spread the disease to several others, boosting the Ro of the disease as\nhigh as 2 to 3 and causing an exponential increase in cases. If the Ro is less\nthan one, the epidemic will gradually decline and stop on its own, with or\nwithout a vaccine.\nA vaccine, however, would be tremendously helpful. There are at least\nten vaccine development projects underway. But the one furthest along at\nthe National Institutes of Health (NIH) is still about six weeks away from\nstarting the process of a phase 1 trial in human volunteers that will\ntake 3 to 4 months to complete and to show that the vaccine safe\nand produces specific antibodies. A phase 2 trial will follow and\nwill take at least 6 to 8 months to determine if the vaccine is\nefficacious in people at risk for infection . Then production would\nneed to be scaled up by a willing pharmaceutical company to deal with a\nglobal crisis. All this in total will take at least a year - assuming there are\nno unpredicted scientific obstacles in th e way.\nOn Mar 2, 2020, at 7:54 AM, Fauci, Anthony (NIH/NIAID) [E]                      CbH>\nwrote:\nMike:\nSocial distancing is not really geared to wait for a vaccine. The major point is to prevent\neasy spread of infections in schools (closing them), crowded events such as theaters,\nstadiums (cancel events), work places (do te lewor king where possible). States and\nlocalities make these decisions, not the Federal government. The goal of social distancing\nis to prevent a single person who is infected to readily spread to several others, which is\nfacilitated by close contact in crowds. Close proximity of people will keep the ROhigher\nthan 1 and even as high as 2 to 3. If we can get the ROto less than 1, the epidemic will\ngradually decline and stop on its own without a vaccine.\n(b)(6)\nNIH-001035\nBest regards,\nTony\nAnthony S.

We believe it could provide relief to a large number of people dur ing\nthe COVI0-19 pandemic. Our produc t SJP-002is a combination of an NSAID and a non-sedating\nantih istamine and does not include a decongestant. Removing the decongestant makes our product\nideal for treating the symptoms associated with COVID-19 in pat ients with cardiac conditions who\ncannot tolerate taking a decongestant.\nWhat makes our product novel is that it can be administered early in the treatment phase, thereby\nreducing the excessive accumulation of inflammat ion, w hich typically results in head congestion,\npulmonary congestion, coughing, & sneezing. Our experience has shown that at the 1st signs of\nexperiencing symptoms of URI an indivi dual's symptoms can be drasti cally reduced after ta king our\nNIH-001094\nproduct twice a day for 3 days. The dramatic reduction in inflammation has the potential to reduce the\nspreading of the virus by means of cough, sneezing, and spreading of germs through cont act. Current ly,\nwhen individuals experience the start of a URI,there is little effective intervention available to change\nthe course of the infection . Individuals delay administer ing pharmaceutical agents, until their\ncongestio n becomes intolerable and excessive.\nAttached is a copy of our early research and a copy of our non-provisional patent.

Both MERSand SARSwere severe,\nshort lived problems that have not recurred. One would expect Covir-19 to follow a simi lar path : infect\na wide group of susceptible people and then disappear, If that is so, anything that is more than six\nmonths away may not be of value-remdisivir or a vaccine. Even if remdisivir works, it will take months\nto produce sufficient amounts to treat this illness.\nHas ribavirin been assessed for an ability to slow down the replication of this virus? We do not need to\neradicate the virus. Just slowing down the rate of symptoms progression would allow time for the\nimmune system to mount a curative response.\nRibivirin is the only approved anti-viral that may have shown some clinical benefit against similar\ncoronavirus infections, but the reports are anecdotal and the benefit short term . It was only\nadministered to a few patients who were already on respirator support, and most still died. If their lungs\nwere already destroyed, eliminating the virus would not change the outcome. There were no studies of\ntreating mild illnesses before they progressed to needing respirator support. If the 50 year old\ncoronavirus patient described in the Lancet had been treated in first week of symptoms, before needing\nrespiratory support, he may have survived . On autopsy, most of his lung had been destroyed .\nIf ribavirin has even marginal benefit, decreasing hospitalization by 10% yields an enormous savings. I do\nnot have accessto the data on this virus and the possible effects of the antivirals that have been\nevaluated.

It pertains to corticosteroids and ARDS. We are raising that this suggests indirect\nevidence that we may be able to extrapolate to the COVID patient with severe illness. This\nwithin the life threatening issue and emergency and no effective treatment. I share if this can\nNIH-001 157\nhelp you as I know you are leading this and listened to you today with the president. I support\nth is p resident fully.\n2) I share a paper published today , it on the other hand raises serious questions on the use of\ncorticosteroids in influenza associated ARDS , and one may argue this patient set, is the closes t to\nthe COV ID 19 pat ient.\nMy sense is that the accumulated evidence thus far is weak and argues against corticosteroids.\nFor example, this recently published multicenter retrospective cohort study in medical center\nICUs across Ta iwan sought to assess the effect iveness of cort icostero ids in patients presenting\nw ith influenza-associated ARDS (viro logy -proven ARDS and are on mechanical vent ilation).\nResearchers examined the impact of early corticosteroid treatment (2:200 mg hydrocortisone\nequivalent dose within 3 days after ICU admission , determined by a sensitivity analysis) on\nsubseque nt hosp ita l mortality. The study revea led that of the 241 pat ients with in fluenza-\nassociated ARDS , those rece iving early cort icostero id had a sign ificantly highe r hosp ital\nmortality rate than those who did not get early corticos teroid [43.5% (37/85) vs. 19.2% (30/ 156),\np < 0.001 ). Early corticosteroid treatment was independently associated with increased hospital\nmorta lity in overall patients [an adjus ted OR of 5.02 (95% CI 2 .39- 10 .54), p < 0 .001) and in all\nexamined subgroups . Researchers found that a higher dose and earli er treatment was linked to\nhigher hospital mortality. Moreover, they found that earlier trea tment was related to a\nsignificantly increased odds of subsequent bacteremia [an adjusted OR of 2.37 (95% CI 1.01-\n5.56)]. These resu lts underscore the urge ncy for robust comparat ive randomized researc h given\nth is study is based on weake r observational evidence that is confounded by select ion bias and\nconfounded. However this was a stronger study that used statistical adjustment and propensity\nscore matching. Thus this study suggests caution with corticosteroid and thus the importance for\ncaut ion by clin icians as to the potential harms of cort icosteroids in th is po pulat ion . These results ,\nwhil e based on weake r methodology , have revea led large estimates of effect, is the stro ngest\nevidence to date on treatment for ARDS , and brings us closest to the COVID- 19 ARDS patient.\nBest,\nPaul E.

Did his being Chinese either ethnically or by\ncitizenship affect anything biologically?\nNIH-001162\nI ask because not only have many Asian people now encountered increased racism in public places\n(due to fear that any Asian person is a source of COVID-19), but now that the President is turning this\nepidemic into additional fear-mongering about \"borders\" it seems all the more important that scientists do\nnot inadvertently add to \"xenophobia\" (even though non-white skin does not mean a person is foreign)\nand do not seem to advance any political perspective.\nSincerely and with best personal regards,\nMargaret\nMargaret A.

Here's a link to a non-technical exp lanation of the paper I shared with you earlier:\nhttps:// insights.so m.yale.edu/insights/new -outbrea ks-of-coronavirus-can-bc-halted-,vith-isolation-m easures -\naccording -to-study\nI have seen predictions stating that upward s of 30% of the wor ld's popu lation will be infected , but I don't see this\nhappening. What I do see are lots of local outbreaks from imported cases, some larger than others , but all headin g\ntowards containment. I find Israel to be an interesting test case. A group of infected Korean tourists who visited the\ncountry only tested positive for coronavirus after their re turn to Korea, joining the large outbreak that has been\nreported there. The itinerary of their travel group has been made public so that retrospectively, [sraeli public health\nofficials could ascertain who was exposed where and when (see\nhttps://www .hea ltb.gov.il/E nglish/News and Events/Spokesper sons Messages/Page s/23 02202 0 J.aspx). Already\n1,600 Israelis have been quarantined on account of possible exposure. It has been twelve days since this group of\ntourists returned to Korea , and no new infect ions have been reported in Israel associated with this group (there are\ntwo Israelis who were infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship , and one infected while in ltaly). See\nhttps://www .ynetn ews.com/artic1e/H l nXPa7E8 . lt will be interesting (and important) to see how many new\ninfections are detected in the days ahead, and if such new infections are found among those already under preventive\nwatch.\nNonetheless I totally concur with preparing as if major tran smission will occur. Much better to err by over- rather\nthan under- preparing (a familiar perspect ive from those bygo ne smallpox debates).\nFinally, a reporter asked me yesterday afternoon what I wanted the Pres ident to say last n.ight. Here was my\nresponse :\nIn a sober way summaiize the facts of lhe ou tbreak, state that the US has an excellent preparedness team between\nCDC and NIH, that at the advice of this team travel restriction s and quarantine measures have already been enact.ed,\nbut as of now the public is at very low risk of infection. Still, citizens should go to cdc.gov now to learn from our\nexperts how to prepare in the event that more extreme measures are needed , stay abreast of the situation here and\nabroad and follow the advice of our experts , get a flu shot(!), and know that the US has a very strong public health\nsy stem that can withstand this cha llenge .\nAnyway,just wanted to share all this with you.

Cover yo ur cough or sneeze with a t issue or the crook of your elbo w rather than your\nhands.\n• There is no need to wear a face mask if you are well and do not have symptoms- masks\nprotect the sick from spread ing germs but wi ll not prevent you from gett ing sick.\n• Do not assume that anyone of Asian descent is more likely to have coronavirus - do not forget\nabout the importance of inclusivity and evidence-based information.\nAgain, we t hank you for your contributions and commitment to Keystone Symposia and w ish for a very\nsuccessful and inspiring meet ing.\nSincerely,\n(b)( 6)\nDebora h L.

White and F.J. Fenner stated\n\"No convincing evidence has yet been obtained to link human coronaviruses with\nserious disease ..., but they are an important cause of that trivial but annoying\ndisease, the common cold.\" This generalization changed drastically with the\nemergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in 2002-2003\n(SARS-CoV), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) immediately sought the\nexpertise of these two scientists at the time. Now, 17 years later, we still do not\nhave an antiviral medicine or a vaccine against the novel coronavirus that\noriginated in China, now designated as COVID-19 by the World Health\nOrganization (WHO). On February 21, there were 75,567 cases and 2,239 deaths\nin China; and 1,152 cases outside China, with 8 deaths, according to the Director-\nGeneral of the WHO. The two viruses appear to use the same gate (or \"receptor\")\non host cells to infect them. Despite such expected similarities between new and\nold strains of the viru s, research on coronaviruses has not been a priority for the\nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). In the end, all that\nthe Director of NIAID was able offer is \"good healthcare\" as a remedy for COVID-\n19 infections.\nThe major reason we do not have a cure for coronaviruses is that there has been\nno coordinated effort by the NIAID to establish long-term research programs\nfocused on coronaviruses . Realizing the insufficient progress in this area,\nthe NIAID announced on February 6 a \"Notice of Special Interest to highlight the\nurgent need for research on the 2019 novel Coronavirus.\" Grants have indeed\nbeen awarded to some scientists since 2003, but such grants are highly\ncompetitive, with success rates of applications to NIAID between 14 and 18%,\nindicating that 82-86% of applicants are unable to obtain funding to carry out\nresearch. The time and effort spent on preparing grant applications to NIH are\nenormous, diverting these precious resources from actual research to what some\nscientists call \"grantsmanship\" (essentially, the ability to sell your idea to a review\ncommittee!). These \"games scientist play\" to procure funding are a hindrance to\nthe progress of science. The fact that we do not have a cure or a vaccine against\ncoronaviruses over the past 17 years since the SARS epidemic, attests to this\ndetrimental effect .\nDevelopment of a vaccine against COVJD-19tis also not straightforward.SARS\nwas probably not considered by NIH to be an important pathogen on which to\nNIH-001216\nspend resources. Even if the biomedical research community had developed a\nvaccine against coronaviruses, pharmaceutical companies would probably not\nhave considered it a profitable endeavor. Therefore, it is essential for public funds\nto be used by NIH and the CDCto both discover an effective vaccine and to\nmanufacture it.\nWe need to ensure that long-term projects to develop antivirals and vaccines\nagainst coronaviruses and other infectious agents, including tuberculosis and\ninfluenza virus, are implemented and fully funded. We need to have a funding\nsystem that does not depend on the often unfounded criticism or whims of grant\nreviewers . Although the current peer review system is touted generally as the\nbest way to allocate funding , it has never been tested scientifically against an\nalternative. While half of the NIH budget (currently $39 billion) may still be\nallocated for high-cost projects, including clinical trials , the other half should be\nawarded for periods of 10 years or longer to established scientists who have a\ntrack-record of scientific work, as well as to young scientists who are starting their\nfirst independent position . The budgets of these grants would be somewhat\nlimited, but would provide uninterrupted funding and alleviate the stress of\ncompeting for renewals every 3-5 years. Scientists opting for these grants will not\nhave to submit extensive grant applications. More importantly , this system will\nmore than double the number of independent investigators . After a 10-12 year\nperiod, the scientific productivity (per grant dollar) of scientists on the classical\ngrant system would be compared with that of scientists on long-term funding.\nAfter all, the way we choose the mode of science funding should conform to the\nway science progresses , by experimentation and analysis .\nNIH-001217","time":"2020-02-27T01:55:00","sender":196,"cc":[196],"subject":"lack of preparedness for the coronavirus pandemic"}],[{"recipients":[197],"body":"We will be looking at this.","time":"2020-02-28T04:05:11+00:00","sender":0,"cc":[],"subject":"RE:Covid-19"},{"recipients":[0],"body":"--------         (b)(6 )1>\nDr. Fauci,\nThis may be terribly simp listic, but if Covid-19 binds to ACE2 recep tors in host cells, has anyone looked\nat ACE2 recep tor blockers as potent ially ameliorating disease severity or infectivity?\nSincerely,\nRobert Alan Durr, M.D.\nNIH-0012 18","time":"2020-02-27T02:03:00","sender":197,"cc":[],"subject":"Covid-19"}],[{"recipients":[198],"body":"George Q.

My question is whether you would consider taking the Acela up Friday evening returning Saturday\nmorning to host this session w ith a presenta tion followed by a Q&A session. If that is not possible,\nwould you be willing to provide a 10-15 minute (shorter if you deem that appropriate) video generated\nth\nas close to the 14 as possible that we would have projected in the main hall as noted above . If the\nlatter, would you have a suggestion of an ID person in Philadelphia who would be knowledgeable and\ncould field quest ions following your video . I recognize t hat even if you are willing to come to\nPhiladelphia, that circumstances could arise that would preclude you r traveling in which case we would\nask for a video if at all possible . Finally, if neither option is possible, is there somebody in DC (includ ing\nNIH), Baltimore or Philadelphia who could provide the short review and then sit for 30-45 minutes of\nQ&A.

Average people gave up their stockpiles of masks so they could be\nshipped to Wuhan . Ne ighb orhood committees brought food to thousands of little old\nladies and checked on them eve ry day, even as they asked them to stay behind their\ndoors for fear of infection.\nMeanwhile , in America, people tend to act like selfish pigs interested only in saving\nthemselves. How can I hoard a mask? Where's my vaccine? This morning , I\nread this appa lling article from A la bama . Here you have Americans com ing back\nfrom a horrifying experience overseas, and the President -- who is popula r in\nAlabama -- asks Alabama ns to take some of those fellow Amer icans in. There is\nzero risk because they're going to be housed on a naval base.\nAnd yet, the answer is \"No! Keep them out!\" And their legislators encourage it....\nI dunno -- that's the kind of behavior I expect from my fellow New Yorker s, not\nfrom Alabama.\nIf the virus arrives -- and we both know it wilJ -- America is going to have to do\nbetter than that. Like the Chinese, Americans are going to have to look out for each\nother the way we haven't since 9/ 11. Or maybe since World War II .\nBut that's not the tone of the HHS briefings .

The only time the tone was right when you\nNIH-001345\nwere the third to take the mike and explain things to that kid shouting from the back\nwithout a mike about \"What's the real message? What do we do?\"\nMaybe there could be some thought given to mentally preparing Americans to work\ntogether in the face of the crisis? Quarantines are a very aggressive approach -- but\nthey require a lot of compassion or the people quarantined suffer.\nI might get around to writing an article about this, but my editors keep grabbing me\nfor minute by minute stuff and I'm way behind.\nDonald\nNIH-001346","time":"2020-02-25T19:07:15-05:00","sender":0,"cc":[],"subject":"Re: thought from a kibb itzer ..."}],[{"recipients":[33],"body":"Please handle.\nBegin forwarded message:","time":"2020-02-25T18:59:02-05:00","sender":0,"cc":[],"subject":"Fwd: Surfactant Protein-D against coronavirus"}],[{"recipients":[299],"body":"David:\nThanks for your note and your keen interest in this important challenge of coronavirus.

My beat is science and technology.\nSince the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in China, I'm covering feature stories about\nthe outbreak, hoping to explain to readers what it is, especially since the virus is evolving daily at an\nunexpected high speed, and in so many confusing ways.\nNow in China we are getting conflicting information about the new virus and thus become confused\nabout it. For example, we are seeing more and more cases that a patient with negative test results for 2\nnon-continuous days, still infected with the virus and tested positive afterwards. It makes the treatment\nreally difficult because it seems hard to determine whether the patient is fully cured or not. Since you\nare an experienced immunologist, I'm wondering if you could share your insights with the Chinese\nreaders and take an interview . The Interview could be via phone or email, whichever works fine for you.\nNIH-001447\nIf possible, I'd love to send you the questions before we talk. Since we have time difference, I might not\nbe available dur ing the early afternoon (your time) but I could make it in the morning, noon and maybe\nlate in the afternoon and evening (your time).\nI'm sorry for bothering you on this subject, but we face severe difficulty in understanding this new virus\nand taking measures properly. We have quite limited sources and perspectives for understanding this\nnew virus . However, as a science reporter, I believe in a crisis of public health, the informat ion is the key\nfor the public. They should have the opportunity to hear more perspectives from different specialists.\nSince you are experienced in fighting against so many viruses, especially SARS,I believe your opinions\nwi ll be inspiring to the readers.\nIt would be of great help and great honor for us to invite you for an interview. A phone call interview\nwould be preferred but if t ime doesn't work for you, is it possible for you to reply via email?

Over\nrecent decades, multiple epidemic events have underscored how highly\nvulnerable we are to viral threat s.

About 75 percent of new human diseases are caused by microbes that\noriginate in animals. These include HIV, influenza (including pandemic HlNl,\nHSNl , and H7N9), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS),Middle East\nRespiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV),Ebola, Marburg, and Nipah. The\nrecent emergence of COVID from China clearly illustrates the magnitude , rapidity\nNIH-001631\nand impact that a new infectious agent can have on global health security.

I have drafted proposed responses for his\nreview , also attached.\n1. Do you believe that SARS-COV2 is capable of causing a pandemic? Are\nyou expecting many secondary transmissions of the virus outside China?\nA pandemic is generally defined as sustained transmission of a new pathogen in\nmultiple regions of the world. COVID-19 does not yet meet that definition , and I\nhope that China and other countries in Asia with some transmission are able to\ncontain the outbreak. However , it is possible that COVID-19 could become a\npandemic. It would not be surprising to see additional secondary transmissions of\nthe virus outside of China.\n2. Chinese authorities are reporting a decline of new cases. Could we say that\nthe virus has peaked and maybe it will slow down? When are you expecting\nto have a clearer picture about the evolution of this epidemic?\nAlthough the number of daily cases in China appears to have gone down , it is\ntoo early to tell if this is really a decline in the outbreak.\n3. Could the virus become endemic and give seasonal outbreaks?\nIf China is not able to contain the outbreak, it is possible COV ID-19 could\nbecome endemic and lead to seasonal outbreaks. However, it is too early to\nknow the likelihood of this scenario.\n4. What about its transmissibility? Some experts say that WHO is\nunderestimating it's transmissibility. Could the reality be different maybe\nbecause, among other things, many cases stay undetected?\nBecause of the many unknowns about SARS-CoV-2 , it is difficult to make any\nfirm conclusions regarding overall transmissibili ty and severity. However , it\nappears to be much more transmissible than SARS. Also , there are likely\nasymptomatic COVID-19 infections that are not getting counted because people\ndo not go to the doctor for testing or treatment if they are not sick.\nNIH-001636\ns. Do you believe that the measures taken by China and countries around the\nworld are adequate to stop SARS-COV2 spread? There is a lot of\ndiscussion about thermal cameras and travel restrictions for example.\nChina has taken extreme measures to control the outbreak. Restricting the\nmovement of 50 million people is unprecedented. However, it might ultimately\nhave an effect on slowing transmission. Precautions implemented in the U.S. are\nnot intended to detect every person with COVID-19 entering the country.\nHowev er, our approach has allowed us time to better plan and prepare our health\nsystem .\n6. What is the key to stop the worldwide spread of the virus?\nThough we have mobilized a rapid research response to quickly develop\neffective countermea sures, right now, the outbreak response remains focused on\nthe proven public health practices of identifying cases , isolating patients and\ntracing contacts.\n7. In the northern hemisphere we have a flu outbreak - in Greece as well.\nSome experts say that this is the real danger and not the coronavirus. What\nis your view?\nI am always concerned about influenza . Every flu season , millions of people are\nat risk of getting very sick or dying. Currently people in the U.S. and most\ncountries in the northern hemisphere are at a much higher risk of being exposed\nto influenza than SARS-CoV-2. However , the COVID-19 outbreak is an evolving\nsituation and we are treating it as a very serious public health threat.\n8. Many efforts are being in process for the development of a vaccine for the\nnew coronavirus . Are you coordinating any of them and which ones? Are\nthere any efforts more promising than others? Which platforms of vaccine\ndevelopment are more promising? When do you believe that we could have\na vaccine available for clinical trials and then for human use?\nNIAID is exp loring multiple candidates and is on track to test an experimental\nmessenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine in a Phase 1 clinical trial this spring. This first\nphase of clinical testing will involve giving the vaccine to healthy adults in the\nUnited States to see if it is safe and if it can induce an immune response in\nrecipients. It is important to realize that the development of investigational\nvaccines and the clinical testing to establish their safety and effectiveness takes\ntime. A vaccine against the novel coronavirus will likely not be widely available\nfor more than a year.\n9. What about therapies? Dozens are being tried - from plasma to herbal\nmedicines in China. Which are the most promising?\nNIAID is pursuing the development of antivirals and monoclonal antibodies for\npotential use against COVID-19. NIAID is preparing protocols for in vitro and in\nvivo studies of the antivi ral remdesivir, which has shown promise agains t other\ncoronaviruses in animal models . NIAID also plans to evaluate Kaletra\n(lopinavir/ritonavir) and interferon-beta for their activity against SARS-CoV-2 . In\naddition, NIAID scientists are working to identify monoclonal antibodies with\nNIH-001637\ntherapeutic potential from stored SARS patient samples as well as COVID-19\npatient samples .\n10. Are the things we know about this new virus more than the ones we don't\nknow? Which are the main questions about it that remain to be answered?\nNew data are published about SARS-CoV-2 every day. However, we still have a\nlot to learn. For example, we do not know why there are so few cases among\nchildren, which is uncommon for a respiratory virus.\n11. How worried should people outside China be about SARS-COV2? What is\nthe biggest danger from this virus?\n. The risk to the general American public remains low at this time ; however , this\ncould change and that is why we are treating the emergence of a novel\ncoronavirus as a very serious public health threat. We understand that\npeople may be worried . We ask that people not let fear or panic guide their\nactions.\n12. Which are the protective measures anyone should take against the new\nvirus? Do masks work?\nThe vast majori ty of people outside of China do not need to wear a mask. A\nmask is more appropriate for someone who is infected than for people trying to\nprotect against infection .\nJennifer Routh [E]\nNews and Science Writing Branch\nOffice of Communicatio ns and Government Relations\nNational Institute of Allergy a nd Infectious Diseases (NIAID)\nNIH/HHS\n31 Center Drive Room 7A17C\nBethesda , MD 20892\nDirect:            Cb)C\nDisclaimer : The informatio n in this e-mail and any of its attachments is confidential an d may contain sensitive informati on.

However , one\nthat I use that is simple and under standable is as follows: An outbreak of a\nserious infectious disease with substantial global health consequences (usually\none that has never before been experienced by the human populat ion) that is\ntransmitted readily from person to person and where there is sustained\ntransmission (i.e . mu ltiple generations of person to person to person) in mu ltiple\ncountries and regions of the world. In this regard, the coronavirus outbreak in\nChina is an \"epidemic\" in China, but it is not yet a pandemic since there is not\n\"sustained\" person to person transmission throughout the world. There are\ninfections in other countries (more than 25 countries), but these started as travel\nrelate d cases from China and although there are several human to human\ninfections in these other countries, these infections have not yet been\n\"sustained\". If we start seeing sustained, multiple generations of transmissions\nin many countries throughout the world, then the outbreak will have progressed\nto fill the criteria of a true pandemic.\nHope that this is helpful.\nBest regards,\nTony\nAnthony S.

This leaves American\nhea lth experts hoping that the number of infections has been dramatically\nunderreported.\nThat is not a typo. If the current nu1nbers are close to accurate, it\nindicates a coronavirus mortality rate upwards of 2 percent. The morality\nrate for the seasonable flu is gen erally .1 percent. The mortality rate for\npandemic flu is .3 percent. The particularly deadly flu pandemic of 1918 -\nNIH-001714\nwhich took the lives of more than 100 million people around the world -\nhad a mortality rate of 1.8 to 2 percent.\nSo, if 2000 deaths is the numerator, scientists hope that the\ndenominator is actually much larger. And that is probable, given the\nlikelihood that there are many more people who have the infection but\ndon't know it, or are not showing symptoms.\nThe good news? The outbreak started in a single location and seems\nlargely contained there. There have been several hundred cases in more\nthan 25 countries outside of China. But the overwhelming majority have\nbeen travel related. The containment measures of Singapore, Hong Kong\nand Japan - which have the most cases - seem to have been successful. Of\nthe 15 American cases (before the arrival of the cruise ship passengers), 13\nare travel related. The two others are spouses of people in that group. We\nstill have not seen widespread, sustained transmission from person to\nperson outside of China.\nThe Chinese reaction to the virus has shown the weaknesses and\nadvantages of authoritarianism. The immediate response of a system built\non fear is to a problem like this one is denial and deception. No one wants\nto carry bad news. So local Chinese officials spent the first week of the\noutbreak - as the disease was spreading under the radar - insisting that the\ntransmission of the virus was all animal to human.\nBut only in a society like China could you have the effective lockdown\nof 50 million people, including the entire city of Wuhan, to slow the spread\nof the disease. Public health officials in most places - who are required to\nbalance health needs with civil liberties - would not even consider such a\nmeasure. Yet it appears to be working.\nThe danger? \"All that is needed is for a few countries in the\ndeveloping world that can't contain the coronavirus,\" Tony Fauci told me.\n\"This could be the second wave of the pandemic.\"\nPandemic diseases tend to attack the weakest links - the most\nvulnerable health systems - in the global chain. If there is sustained\ntransmission in those places , says Fauci , \"even countries with best practices\nwill suffer.\" Countries in Africa are of particular concern. There are millions\nof Chinese in Africa, and many Africans study in China. Countries such as\nEthiopia, Senegal and South Africa seem to be doing a good job at testing\nrandom samples for coronavirus in key cities. But Liberia? Guinea? Sierra\nLeone?\nSeldom has there been a stronger argument for American global\nengagement to strengthen African health systems, which constitute part of\nown immune system against pandemics. Seldom has there been a better\nNIH-001715\nargument to abandon \"America First\" posturing and to recognize that our\nown fate is closely tied to the fate of other nations.\nMuch about the future course of the disease depends on the answer to\na scientific question: Is someone who has the virus but lacks symptoms - or\nhas symptoms so mild they hardly notice - capable of transmitting the\nvirus to others? \"It looks like the answer is yes,\" says Fauci. Which would\nmake the virus far harder to control.\n\"We may find that the virus is highly transmissible, but less lethal\nthan we thought in the beginning,\" Fauci told me . In this case, the danger\nwould be similar to a particularly bad influenza. And the outbreaks could be\nseasonal, like the flu as well. \"I would not be surprised if that happened,\"\nFauci concluded.\nNIH-001716","time":"2020-02-20T11:04:00","sender":30,"cc":[],"subject":"Tony, I'm still working on this, but need your reaction"}],[{"recipients":[33],"body":"Please handle.\nAnthony S.

The meeting is set to take place on Thursday, February\n20, 2020 from 9:30am to 1:30pm at the World Bank Offices in Washington DC (located at 1818 H St\nNW) on floor C2, conference room MC C2-125.\nAs you know, the novel Coronavirus outbreak, which started in Wuhan, China, is evolving rapidly. As of\ntoday, the number of confirmed cases has increased significantly to over 60,000 and the virus has\nreached 25 countries. The outbreak, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), poses\na threat to countries worldwide, especially those with weak health systems and low levels of pandemic\npreparedness.\nIt is of urgent importance that we move quickly to finance the development of the appropriate\ncountermeasures for a disease that risks becoming endemic across the globe. Two critical issues are\nnecessary to address: i) immediate financing for the development and scale-up of a diversified portfolio\nof vaccines, and ii) financing the manufacturing and procurement of vaccine for global distribution.\nTo enhance our discussions we are working on a background paper which we will share along with an\nagenda at the earliest. Recognizing the short notice, we will provide remote connection details for those\nunable to travel for the meeting. A working lunch will also be provided.\nWe hope that you will be able to participate in this important meeting.

are trying to contain it but\nnew infections keep showing up earl golden for example he was a passenger on the\ndiamond princess that's the cruise ship where hundreds of people got the virus we\ntook an aquatic clues to also alone what went wrong who knew we were going and\nthe crew and beautiful omar here's how he ended up in omaha earl his wife jerry\nwere quarantined on that ship for twelve days in a felt fine the whole time but then\nthe gun on a flight back to the u. s. and earl started feeling sick or wind burke from\njapan to this day about two hours into the flight they woke up with a high fever after\nnapping a little bit and the doctors on board confirmed the and then on the flight\nlanded he tested positive for the coronavirus he's recovering now in a bio contain\nmean unit at the university of nebraska's medical center he's going to have to spend\nfourteen days there and isolation well you know working %hesitation %hesitation\ncatering we've heard on a but one of the two days of the different doctors each day i\nNIH-001748\ndidn't have a clue but got a little cough still you can you might want to debate left me\nand i'm a little to keep but maybe also because of the jet lag in the travels and\neverything else on top of it no it doesn't feel any different than you know recuperating\nfrom a regular coal earl's wave jerry hasn't been diagnosed with the virus is she's\nbeing monitored in a different part of the hospital but their case is a good example of\nsome things we know and some things we don't know about how this virus is\nspreading so we have called doctor anthony fauci he's director of the national\ninstitute of allergy and infectious diseases good morning sir good morning so earl\ncoleman was fine all those days on the ship then he gets on a plane and he gets a\nfever what does that tell us about how this virus is spreading well the virus has the\nability to bind it to certain cells in your body particularly in your long so you can get\nanything from miles a symptomatic illness to a cough and a fever to some people\nabout oh about twenty percent of the people come to the attention of medical than\nphysicians in health care providers can get serious pneumonias requiring intensive\ncare it sounds like this individual is on the %hesitation mild side of the illness\nbecause as he said it doesn't feel much more than just a common cold and as a\nmatter of fact corona viruses in general prior to this all one of the causes of the\ncommon cold okay so what does that tell us i mean bleary often looking at the cases\nwe're looking at a rising death toll which is tragic we look much less at the people like\nearly say you know my voice is raspy a had a fever had a cough the years a wide\nrange of stuff symptoms with this virus did do do we know why some people seem to\nbe doing okay and other people are getting hit really hard well whether a couple\nthings about that for the first thing is that any any kind of viral infection or any\npathogen infection there's always a wide range of responses in the sense almost like\na bill shaped curve some people get no sim is at all and we do have a symptomatic\ncorona virus infection with this particular episode and then there's the bulk of people\nwho get some sort of symptoms and then a small percentage of people do really\nreally very poorly now that relates to the ability of the body to handle the virus and\nthe one thing we know when it's not unique to this virus is that the elderly those with\nunderlying conditions like chronic heart disease lung disease diabetes obesity they\ntend to get more complications much more than for example and otherwise healthy\nindividual and that's the reason why if you look at the death rate which is around two\npercent for this disease at this time it is disproportionately high are among the elderly\nand particularly those who have underlying conditions this is interesting question\ncarlin is wave terry presumably they work together the entire time they were\nquarantined right and if he gets the virus she does not did she just get lucky do some\npeople have some sort of immune undefended don't it's a combination that's a good\nquestion it's a combination of both there is no virus that has one hundred percent\nattack rate even the most of infectious of all viruses like measles doesn't get a\nhundred percent of of %hesitation vulnerable people but respiratory viruses\nparticularly things like influenza or the corona virus the attack rate is burying\npercentage and it was if he was really likely that his wife i don't think she necessarily\nhad any on the line immune protection though that's possible the maybe some cross\nreaction of immune protection with other %hesitation microbes that she came into\ncontact with but in most likely is as you suggest the luck of the draw okay interesting\nNIH-001749\nand they got to patching wondered if you could clear something up because we've\nbeen hearing reports about so called super spread ours these you who spread the\nvirus to a very high a number of other people and it sounds like a scary thing but and\ni just under is this a real phenomenon there that there are people who give the virus\nto more people than most and why is that happening well it is certainly the\nphenomenon of the super spreading israel we story with sars back in two thousand\ntwo and two thousand in three and they're episodes already with this particular new\ncorona virus and it's a combination of two things it's an individual whose either at a\nparticular moment in time shedding a very large amount of virus which makes it\nmuch easier to infect a group of people who are around him but you also see it\nsometimes in the hospital setting when you have a number of health care providers\ntaking care of someone and that person is shedding a lot of virus so the short\nanswer to your question is there are super spread is and it's a real phenomenon\nokay okay what we would you say at this moment is the most important or the most\npressing question about this virus that we don't have answers to yet well what we\ndon't know for sure we know that there are people who are infected will without\nsymptoms or very minimal symptoms they hardly notice they're infected well we don't\nknow is the extent to which people who have no symptoms are spreading it so we do\nknow that this can occur because we have anecdotal documented cases of people\nwho do not have symptoms who actually have infected someone usually a family\nmember but we don't know the extent to which this cars in the broad component of\nthis outbreak doctor anthony fauci the director of the national institute of allergy and\ninfectious diseases sir thanks for joining

Since this substance is usually not within the average reader's\nspecial competence, such readers will particularly benefit if the editorial avoids technical jargon , explains the\narticle's contribu tion to a field of knowledg e, and emphasizes , whenever possibl e, its clinical implications. The\neditorial commentary should not be concerned exclusively with the article in question but rather should use the\narticle as a starting point for a more genera l discussion.\nBecause editorials involve interpretation and opinion, you and your potential coauthor must be free of significant\nNIH-001807\nrelevant financial associations (including equity interest, regular consultancies , or major research support) with a\ncompany, or with a competing company, that stands to gain from the use of a product discussed in the editorial.\nPlease contact me immediate ly if you are considering a coauthor , so I can ensure that your candidate meets our\ncriteria. Additional information about disclosure of financial and other associations appears below this letter.\nPlease bear in mind that your editoria l represents your (and any coautho r's) personal opinion. The Journal does not\ninclude statements of grant or other support or acknowledgments with editorials.\nJournal po licy dictates that we must have on file a signed Copyright Transfer and Authorship Agreement from each\nauthor before a manuscript can be accepted.

This means that your word count before editing should not\nexceed 750 words (approximately 4500 characters). Note that we spell out trial names and most other abbreviations\nfor our readers, and we include trial registration numbers for any clinical trials mentioned; these will lengthen your\neditorial if you have not included them. Please provide a title not exceeding 45 characters and a word count for the\ntext; the entire manuscript , including references , should be double-spaced.\nREFERENCES\nCite no more than 10 references , including the article you are writing about. The average collection of 10 references\nrequires about a quarter of a printed page.\nTABLE OR FIGURE\nA table or a figure in your edito,ial will require a reduction in the number of words ; because figures and tables vary\nin size, you may be asked to shorten the text of your editorial during the production process.

Sorry to get this to you late but it seems the news\nchanges everyday. As you will see I focus mostly on coro navirus as 1 suspect that's where the interest will be but get\nto bio weapons toward the end.\nl am happy to take additional questions or suggestio ns. These sess ions go quickly and we ha ve time for Q and A so I\ndoubt I will get through it all but wanted you all to have something to look at.\nThanks again for doing this tomorrow.\nBest\nFran\nNIH-0018 14\nThis ongoing 2019 novel coronavirus, or COVID-19 , outbreak has a number of historic firsts. It's the largest\nquarantine in world history with China locking down over 60 million people. It's the first mass repatriation of\nAme1ican citizens into a quarantine , climbing over 1,000.\nLet's start with some quick basics: what is coronavirus? How contagious? What is the morbidity rate?\nHow does it compare to SARs and MERs? More/less infectious? Lethal?\nJust to put this in perspective every year here in the US we deal with the flu. How many Americans on average die\neach year from the flu?\nBut as I mentioned corona virus has resulted in a number of historic firsts , talk about what you expect could be our\nscientific firsts and what roadblocks do those scientific firsts confront?\nOver the years, global economic interdependence has grown in nearly every industrial sector, including health care.\nBut that means our health care is also globally interdependent on other systems less equipped, less transparent and\nperhaps less responsible global actors .\nChina closed the wet market where the coronavirus outbreak began on 1/l , gene sequenced the virus on l/9 so they\ncould develop a diagnostic test but did not share the gene sequence with the global hea lth community until 1/ 12.\nHow transparent and quick was the Chinese response? What should the have done that they failed to do? What were\nthe consequences?\nChina now claims more than 70K infected and almost 1800 deaths from the virus. But Jt has been widely reported\nthat the Chinese have underreported both numbers. what are Countries international obligations to report accurately?\nTo whom? How do you know the numbers are accurate?\nHow does the cwTent outbreak impact the domestic medical supply chain? What steps could or should we consider\nto enhance supply chain resilience?\nWhat do the numbers suggest to you about what to expect regionally and worldwide? Have numbers peaked? Will\nthey continue to 1ise? With the cruise ship there re now a total of 15 Americans infected. Do you expect additional\ncases? What scale? How prepared are we nationally? Locally?\nLooking back over the roughly past decade , emerging infectious diseases played a recurring ominous theme . Be it\nfrom HlNl, to ebo la, then Zika, and now the 2019 novel coronavirus, the threat is clearly not dissipating. When it\ncomes to non-disease natural disasters , the Stafford Act provides a Disaster Relief Fund to enable immediate\nresponse. By comparison , there is a small Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund. Do we need a more\nStafford Act-like mechanism to enable quicker response and research to these new threats? What other actions can\nwe take to better prepare ?\nWhile often we see folks painting emerging infectious diseases and biodefense into separate categories , the truth is\nthat there is significant crossove r in terms of preparedness and research. Understanding that this is a sensitive topic,\ncould you talk about how we should approach these risks in a comprehensive manner that can achieve public health\nand national security objectives concurrent ly?\nI'd like to use this to transition to the topic of bio weapons which is what we originally planned to talk about. The\nlandscape here has also transfom1ed. When BioShield was written and the Strategic National Stockpile established\nwe worried about State actors deploy ing banned weapons like small pox; plague and hemorrhag ic fever. And you\nNIH-001815\nstill must prepare against those things as well as new and emerging threats like the toxins we have seen deployed by\nRussia and North Korea in more targeted assassinations.\nHow do you stay ahead of these threats? Do we have the resources and surveillance that we need to stay ahead of the\nthreat? And ensure the necessary vaccines and therapeutics?\nThe ebola outbreak may be an instructive example , it seems to be coming under some control despite the precarious\nsecurity situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo. But the ongo ing 2018 outbreak was the second largest in\nhistory following the 2013-2016 West African outbreak. As a result of these outbreaks, the United States\ngovernment has pioneered new FDA-approved diagnostics and vaccines , with promising therapeutics seemingly\naround the approval comer too. What lessons can we draw from the ebola outbreaks? How do you work with and\nincentivize industry to develop what you need in the event of a catastrophic bio attack? And How do you make the\nbest possible decisions about the stockpile?\nI always worried that because we are global leaders if there was a bio attack or outbreak anywhere in the world,\nothers would look to us and to our stockpile for the answer. Are our global allies doing enough to prepare against\nthese tbreats--whether they be manmade or natural? Are they maintaining adequate stockpi les of medical\ncountermeasures and research bases--and should they be?\nLastly (if we have time) ....the FBI recently arrested a Harvard scientist for accepting undisclosed grant money from\nChina for scientific research. It bas now been reported that there are similar investigations at a number of US\nuniversities including Yale and MIT to name two and that the grant monies are in the billions. What are foreign\ngovernments looking for? Why in the US? Clearly a national security risk, is it a bio weapons concern?\nDISCLAIMER: This e-mail message and any attachments are intended solely for the use of the person(s) named in\nthe message header to whom the email is addressed and may contain information that is confidential or legally\nprivileged. rfyou are not the intended recipient , you are hereby notified that any dissemination , distribution,\ncopying , or other use of this message or its attachments is strictly prohibited .

The RO is about 2.0\nto 2.2. Also, the situation is as we have discussed on several occasions . In the USA, the travel restrictions seem to\nbe working with only 15 cases in the USA (13 travel and 2 spouses) . But, as I have said, this could change. Ifwe\nget substantial sustained transmission in a numbe r of countries throughout the world, including the developing\nworld, then sooner or later there will be significant leakage of infect ed individuals into the US A since you can not\nrestr ict inco ming travel from the w hole woild. T he way we might be able to avoid a real globa l pandemic is if t he\nnon -Chfoa countr ies can co nta in the infect ions in their respec tive count ries before there is widely distrib uted\nsustained transmissions. Once w idely d istributed sustained transmissions happen, a g loba l pandemic is inevitable.\nWhat would a global pand emic mean? ft depends on the true rate s of morbidity and mortality. The curre nt ly\nrepo rted mortality of COVI D-19 is about 21/o. However, there are seve ra l folds more cases than a re com in g to the\nofficial attention of h ea lth autho1ities, i.e . asymptomatic or minima lly symptomatic in fections .

To date we have identified fourteen mutations in\nSpike that are accumulating. Mutations are considered in a broader phylogenetic context,\ngeographically , and over time, to provide an early warn ing system to reveal mutations that may confer\nselective advantages in transmissio n or resistance to interventions. Each one is evaluated for evidence\nof positive selection, and the implications of the mutation are explored t hrough structural modeling . The\nmutation Spike 0614G is of urgent concern; it began spreading in Europe in early February, and when\nintroduced to new regions it rapidly becomes the dominant form . Also, we present evidence of\nrecombination between locally circulating strains, indicative of multiple stra in infections .

W e would be honored if Dr. Fauci would \"virtually\" present Avi with\nhis award .\nAs we collectively navigate the severe impact of COVID-19 on the world and late calls for\nnation-wide social distancing, the Internet has become the lifeblood for people looking\nfor accurate information about the novel coronavirus. Since launching the site on\nDecember 29th , Avi Schiffmann's tracking site was a necessary tool that sounded the\nalarm on the novel coronavirus and its spread, notably calling attention to its severity\nlong before many global officials. By providing over 100 million visitors with real-time\ndata on the virus' spread, Schiffmann has helped people around the globe understand\nCOVID-19 and the necessity of upgrades to current health care systems and mea sures to\nflatten the curve.\nFor having the fore sight to track the global spread of COVID-19 and for creating a\nwebsite to provide real-time data about the virus to people everywhere, it is our great\nprivilege to honor Avi Schiffmann as the 2020 Webby Person of the Year. The\ncelebration will highlight the important work Avi and his fellow winners are doing, and\nwill mark his hallmark Webby 5-Word acceptance speech in Int ernet history. Dr. Fauci's\npresenter speech could be recorded on his phone and we can send you through a script\nfor him to review, edit and details for format and deadline.\nThis year's Webby Aw ards w ill also take action, t he impact of COVID-19 and govern ment\nresponses around the world, has brought the importance of vot ing into sharp focus. The\nWebby Awards has partnered with Vote.or and aim to check the voter registration status\nof 1 million voters in the United States, promoting the importance of voting to help ensure\nvote r turnout this November is the highest it has ever been. This partnership will integrate\ninto all elements of this year's on line celebration.\nOur thoughts are with all of you in this difficult time.\nBest\nLesley Cahill Roy\n(b)(6)","time":"2020-05-01T12:13:00","sender":477,"cc":[],"subject":"Re: Dr. Anthony Fauci & Avi Schiffman/The Webby Awards"}],[{"recipients":[0],"body":"Dear Tony,\n1.

She seems to suggest covid 19 is a virus tha t rather attacks the blood cell, le ading to respi ratory\nand other organ comp lications, hence they need to loom at tre atme nt in a differ ent light. In the UK\nsome hospitals have moved away from using ventilators due to the high death rate of those on\nventilators, and are rat her using ventilators for sleep apnea, as they are less invasive, and the resu lts are\nmuch much better compared to invasive ve ntilators\nThere are some anecdotal observations I have also made. The infection rate in most African countries\nseem to be comparatively low, w hich could possibly due to the rate of testing being conducted.\nHowever t he death rates are also comparative ly very low. From in itial informat ion with regards to\nhydroxychloroquine and some antimalaria drugs usage, it was suggested that those who were alleged\nto have had some benefits had mild symptoms of covid 19. I know some clinical trials have shown\nhydroxychloroquine not to be effect ive in the treatment of covid 19 in very ill patients. However, my\nhypothesis is, are the low death rates in Africa linked to the fact that malaria is very prevelant in Africa,\nand lots of Africans take antimalarial drugs, making them less susceptible to covid 19, hence the low\ndeath rate. Is there a similar trend in other countries where malaria is prevalent? Is there an unintended\nbenefit of taking antimalarial drug (or other medication) before covid infection, or at the onset, making\npeople less susceptible to covid19 .\nAs I said, this is based on anecdota l observations.\nYours sincerely\nAto Stephens","time":"2020-05-01T04:53:00","sender":525,"cc":[],"subject":"Coronavir us: Covid 19"}],[{"recipients":[33],"body":"Attachment s:           Brown et al submitted .pdf, NIH Presentation final.pptx,\nprepr ints202002.0147.v2 (1).pdf, Mosaheb et al 2020.pdf\nCristina :\nPlease take a good look at th is.

REUTERS/CarlosBarria\nThe dramatic announcement by Dr Anthony Fauci in the Oval Office on Wednesday prompted concerns\namong scientists that the Trump administration was raising hopes about a coronav irus treatment before\nsharing the full data with researchers.\nAs a cautionary example of inflating the potential value of a therapy, some pointed to President Donald\nTrump's repeated endorsements of malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a treatment , with no evidence\nthat it works .\nNewer data suggests the malaria treatments may carry significant risks for some sufferers of the\nrespiratory disease caused by the virus.\nFauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which is running the\ntrial, said he took the first opportunity to get the word out that patients taking a dummy treatment or\nplacebo should be switched to remdesivir in hopes of benefiting from it .\nHe expressed concern that leaks of partial information would lead to confusion . Since the White House\nwas not planning a daily virus briefing, Fauci said he was invited to release the news at a news\nconference with Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards(D). \"It was purely driven by ethical concerns,\" Fauci\ntold Reuters in a telephone interview.\n\"I would love to wait to present it at a scientific meeting, but it's just not in the cards when you have a\nsituation where the ethical concern about getting the drug to people on placebo dominates the\nconver sation .\"\nAn independent data safety and monitoring board , which had looked at the preliminary results of the\nNIAID trial, determined it had met its primary goal of reducing hospital stays.\nOn Tuesday evening, that information was conveyed in a conference call to scientists studying the drug\nglobally.\n\"There are literally dozens and dozens of investigators around the wo rld/' Fauci said. \"People were\nstarting to leak it.\" But he did not give details of where the unreported data was being shared.\nSeveral scientists interviewed by Reuters felt the White House sett ing seemed inappropriate for the\nrelease of highly anticipated government-funded trial data on the Gilead therapy .\nThey had expected it to be presented simultaneously in a detailed news release, a briefing at a medical\nmeet ing or in a scientific journal, allowing researchers to review the data.\nInformat ion from various trials of remdesivir has been leaked to media in recent weeks . In a statement\non Wednesday, Gilead said the NIAID's much anticipated trial had met its primary goal, but gave no\ndetails .\nData in a separate NIAID statement after Fauci spoke detailed preliminary results showing that patients\nwho got the drug had a 31 percent faster t ime to recovery than those who got a placebo, cutting\nhospital stays by four days.\nThe trial also came close to showing the drug helped people survive the disease, but the data fell just\nshort of statistical significance.\n\"I want to see the full data . I want to understand the statistics. I want to understand the benefit and risk.\nI want to understand the structure of the study, and all of it,\" said Dr. Steven Nissen, the chief academic\nofficer at the Cleveland Clinic.\n\"Am I encouraged from what I've heard? Yes, I'm encouraged . But I want to get a full understanding of\nwhat happened here, and not get it via a photo opportunity from the Oval Office .\"\nData Gilead released on its own trial of remdesivir drew less attention, as it did not compare outcomes\nbetween those receiving therapy and those who did not .\nResults from a third study in China suggesting remdesivir failed to help COVID-19 patients were released\nin the British medical journal the Lancet after review by a peer group of scientists .\n\"That's the only thing I'll hang my hat on, and that was negative ,\" said Dr. Eric Topol, directo r and\nfounder of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California.\nHe was unimpressed by remdesivir's modest benefit .\n\"It was expected to be a whopping effect,\" Topol added . \"It clearly does not have that .\"\nAt the Oval Office news conference, Fauci compared the study findings to AZT, the fi rst drug to show any\nbenefit against HIV, decades ago.\n\"We know that was an imperfect drug. It was the first step,\" Fauci said in the interview.\n\"Similar to AZT, it's (remdesivir) the first baby step towards what hopefully will be a number of better\n11\ndrugs that will come in and be able to treat people with COVID-19.\n11\n(This story has been refiled to correct spelling of \"clinical in paragraph one)\nReporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by M ichele Gershberg and Clarence Fernandez\nOur Standards :The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles .\nDisclaimer: Any third-party material in this email has been shared for internal use under fair use provisions\nof U.S. copyright law, without further verification of its accuracy/veracity.

Sara\nAlert is being provided free of any costs and deployed in state, tribal, and local health departments to\nsupport public health in contact tracing and active monitoring of individuals in isolation and quarantine.\nWe are engaged with ASTHO, NACCHO,CSTE,and the application is hosted live on APHL's AIMS\nplatform. Sara Alert officially launched on April 3 and is currently supporting multiple jurisdictions\nincluding Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Danbury, CT, and the State of Arkansas. It is\nalso being rolled out in Washington, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maine and Vermont. We are getting\nready to launch in additional jurisdictions over the next couple of weeks.\nWe have recently responded to questions we were told came from the White House so I wanted to\nmake sure you have background materials. I imagine you are the person that the President and Vice\nPresident would turn to for information. I am happy to arrange any briefing mater ials or demo that\nwould be helpful for you to respond.\nAs I mentioned previously, Sara Alert is a standards -based, open source tool that automates the process\nof mon itoring individuals exposed to or infected w ith COVID-19 (or any disease, it's configurable) - and\nwi ll serve as an enduring national resource to contain disease. Sara Alert is free for use by public health\norganizations.\nBest wishes to you.

Sara Alert automates the process of monitoring individuals exposed to or infected\nwith COVID-19 (or any disease, it's configurable) - and will serve as an enduring national resource to\ncontain disease. Sara Alert is free for use by public health organizations .\n• Sara Alert allows public health officials to import and enroll individuals (or households) at risk of\ndeveloping or infected with COVID-19.\n• Individuals enter their symptoms daily via web, text, email or phone, allowing public health\nofficials to focus on high risk and non-reporting individuals .\n• The web-based tool enables increased efficiency in tracking cases, leading to earlier\ncontainment of the virus and reduction of burden on public health resources.\n• Sara Alert is a national system and allows transferal of monitorees across jurisdictions for tighte r\ncontact tracing.\nSara Alert launched on April 3 and is now supporting multiple jurisdictions .\nSara Alert YouTube Video : https://youtu.be/lQxAuNsg-RA\nPaul E.

Moons ago I was set to write to you after reading your wonderful\nbook, but I ended up instead speaking with others about it. I should add at this\npoint that I did not quickly respond to your email of a few days ago because I\nsimply missed it.\nIt is true that I strongly suggest that OPV be quickly (already it is not quickly)\nbrought forward for induction of a strong innate immune response to prevent or\nmarkedly reduce SARS-CoV-2infection and/or severity until the field obtains a\nproven safe and efficacious vaccine producing a long lasting, adaptive immunity .\nOPV is very safe (notably for OPV 1 and 3 as bOPV which we will use and\ncompletely safe in a vaccinated population), simple, cheap, rather obvious, yet\nunique among the massive number of vaccines many (maybe most) of which are\nthe same or at least if not exactly the same aiming at the same mechanism\n(targeting the spike and searching for the putative correlate of neutralizing Abs.).\nOPV should work for a few months and possibly longer. Also it should be working\nmultip le times so I think could cover more than a few months, giving us time for a\nproven vaccine of adaptive immunity, which might be very long lasting as is hoped.\nIn the main the WHO comments are correct. Of course we sought and have letters\nof support from them as well as from many others . Though they are again\nsupportive in their notes to you, there is one item that surprises me. They add\nthat there was no clinical efficacy results as yet. They know or certainly should\nknow that there is plenty of clinical data for this concept with BCG,OPV, and live\nMeasles vaccine. Needless to say this is what turned me on during our regular\nGlobal Virus Network (GVN)conference calls. (Incidentally GVN is an organization I\nhave thought of bring ing to your attention. I th ink you would find it impressive and\nuseful) . I would be happy to share with you the clinical observations with OPV if\nyou wish.\nI would like to take a small diversion, but I suspect you are aware of these things.\nMy colleagues and I respect the WHO because of its representation and because\nwe have colleagues/friends there as well. However, sometimes bureaucracy of a\nmassive degree leads to inaction or even much worse-- political expediency. I won't\nbother you with details of these unless you ask, but I had such experiences with\nst\nHTLV-1 which we discovered in 1980 as the 1 human retrovirus and which cause\nnot only the highest incidence of cancer(% of infections) of any virus and other\nfatal diseases as well but mainly in less developed countries (plus Japan) and again\nwith HIV in 1984. Behavior was not beneficial. Perhaps it will be of relevance in the\nfuture because a few at WHO took a position to remove OPV (Sabin) in favor of IPV\n(Salk) in their polio eradication scheme. It was a huge failure. As my FDA\ncollaborator, Konstantin Chumakov, says \"Blessed be Bill Gates\" because he saved\nOPV and saved the day and in so doing has produced a still better OPV.\nThere is indeed data also for BCGas well as live Measles though I know less of the\nlatter. BCG is less available, requires injection, harder to make, not as safe, and we\nthink unlikely to be as effective as OPV. Nonetheless, we favor its use too. The\nmechanisms will be similar.\nYou asked whether monkey trials are planned. For several reasons definitely not --\nthough we are planning some monkey experiments, but not large enough for\n\"clinical\" conclusions. The main reasons are: 1) cost; 2) that billions not thousands\nor millions have received OPV safely and in our collective view (and we know the\nstudies pretty well) protection has been clinically shown; 3) In a pandemic we\nwished to move quickly (so far we must say that has not been achieved). A typical\nmonkey vaccine study will take time, but 4) in this case it would be a huge amount\nof lost time as monkeys require great doses of polio for infection and monkeys\nhave to be trained to drink their orange juice. It would be hard to imagine that such\nstudies would even give us useful information.\nOn a final digression Francis I have had 36 years of on/off experiences with\nglycosylated spike proteins-their analyses immunologically and especially\nregarding use in vaccines and developing neutralizing Abs. I believe it will be a\nmistake to put most eggs in that basket. The risks: shortened antibody half life; 2)\nprotection NOT correlating with neutralizing Abs; 3) sometimes hazards from them.\nAdmittedly, they might work, but I trust and hope that not everything is going in\nthis bag. If you wish to discuss this again I will be available.\nFinally, I hd no idea you were into vaccines or SARS-2nor any part of CoVID-19\ndisease, but I am very happy to learn this.\nThanks.\nBob Gallo","time":"2020-05-03T12:07:00","sender":578,"cc":[],"subject":"RE: Your query to Dr. Kadlec"},{"recipients":[578],"body":"CAUT ION; Tbis message 01iginnted from    II   oon UMB, UMSOM, FPI , or UMMS cmnil sys tem .

Bob Kadlec asked me to respond to\nyour query about the possible use of OPV to activate innate immunity and provide\nCOVID-19 protection. Has t his been tested in a non-human primate model? I note\nthe recommendation below that says a clinical trial is planned - can you tell me\nmore about that?\nAs you can imag ine, we are all flat out on the vaccine development pathway!\nFrancis\nThe use of oral polio vaccine(OPV) to prevent SARS-CoV2(Polio Eradication\nCampaign)\nThere is no ev idence that ora l poliovirus vaccine (OPV) protects people against\ninfection with COVID-19 virus.\nA clinical trial address ing this question is planned in the USA, and WHO w ill\nevaluate the evidence when it is available.\nIn the absence of evidence , WHO does not recommend OPV vaccination for the\nprevention of COVID-19. WHO continues to recommend OPV as part of essentia l\nimmunization services to prevent poliomyeli tis and as part of global polio\neradication efforts.\nThere are experimental signals from various studies over the years that OPV has\nnon-spec ific effects on the immune system. These effects have not been well\ncharac t erized and the ir clinical relevance is unknown. Such non-specific effects may\nnot be limited to OPV, as other live vaccines have also been associated with non-\nspecific protective    effects (such as BCGvaccine against tuberculosis).        No n live\nvaccines in contrast do not seem to have the same effects.\nThe exact mechanism of non-specific           protection    induced by live vaccines needs to\nbe elucidated   f urther. Clinical studies could begin immed iately because the\nvaccines in question     are licensed and have an excellent safety record. Clinical tria ls\ninvolving off-label   use of various drugs licensed for other indications       are currently\nunderway. The existing scientific rationale suggests that the same should be done\nfor OPV and other live vaccines. A study is currently          be ing discussed with various\npartners and vaccine manufacturers,        including the US FDA,the outcomes of which\nwill be carefully assessed to determine potential use in the context of the spread of\nSARS-CoV2 until the time when specific vaccines and antiviral therapies are ready.","time":"2020-04-30T05:00:00","sender":136,"cc":[579,580,263,77,80,21],"subject":"You r query to Dr. Kadlec"},{"recipients":[136,578],"body":"Dr Gallo thank you for your note and I appreciate you reaching out to me.

We\nlived two blocks away on 85 th .\nLong ago parishioners like me remember what\nthe store looked like, the\nsoda fountain that ran along the right wall, the\ntelephone booths at the left close to the\nentrance and the counter straight ahead down\nthe center.\nWhenever my mother sent me there, Mr. Fauci\nwould be behind the\ncounter, but it was a family enterprise. They\nlived in an apartment above the store, and if the\npatriarch wasn't serving you, his wife, Eugenia,\nor daughter, Denise, was there. Young Anthony,\nI've since learned, pitched in too, his father\nsending him out on his bike to deliver items to\ncustomers.\nI've never met the man who has become the\nmost important medical voice in the country. Nor\nhave former parishioners that I've spoken to\nabout him in recent days, like boyhood pals\nAnthony LoFrisco, from\n80th St., now in Connecticut, and Bob Orlando,\nwho lived on 84th, now a New Jersey resident,\nas well as Bishop Gerald Barbarito of the Palm\nBeach Diocese, from 11th Ave. But each\nremembers the pharmacy as a Dyker Heights\ninstitution.\nWhile we don't know him personally, in a sense\nhe's become everyone's\nfriend. With his steady television presence, he's\nimparted his vast knowledge and\nstraightforward advice in a trademark,\nsometimes gravelly or raspy, Brooklyn accent\nthat has endeared him to people far and wide.\nYou can't be anything but proud of someone of\nhis prominence who came from the parish.\nAnthony became known as Tony, as he tells it,\nwhen Father Flanagan,\nprincipal of Regis High School, decided to call\nhim that on his first day as a freshman. The\nname stuck.\nTony took buses and trains to the Jesuit school\nin Manhattan, including the old Sea Beach\nExpress. He traveled 70 minutes each way, did\nthree hours of homework, captained the\nbasketball team and excelled in the classroom.\nI remember hearing that when Tony was a high\nschooler, he had a part-\ntime job working in St. Bernadette's rectory,\nanswering the phone and doing whatever else\nparishioners wanted him to do to put them in\ntouch with one of the parish priests. In those\ndays, the rectory had a priestly bonanza. There\nwere four of them.\nBecause St. Bernadette's School had not yet\nbeen established, Tony went to Our Lady of\nGuadalupe School, where he was taught by\nDominican Sisters. It was, and is, St.\nBernadette's neighboring parish.\nLike most kids, he loved sports. He played CYO\nbaseball and basketball. At Dyker Park on 86th\nSt., he and his friends developed skills in\nimitation of their heroes. A Yankee follower\nliving in the midst of Brooklyn Dodgers fans who\nadored The Boys of Summer, he's said his\nfavorite players were Joe DiMaggio and Mickey\nMantle.\nTony's father and mother married at 18, after\nthey graduated from New\nUtrecht High School. Steve went on to Columbia\nto study pharmacy.\nSometime after he opened his pharmacy, he\nbecame friends with Father Al Varriale, one of St.\nBernadette's beloved parish priests. At one\npoint, Steve, as a parent, and the priest known\nas Father V, who directed the parish's robust\nCYO sports program for youths, shared a\nconcern. It was the easy availability of indecent\nand immoral publications that they knew was a\nthreat to the moral development of young\npeople.\nSo, with the approval and support of the Diocese\nof Brooklyn, together they formed a diocesan\ncommission against pornography. Both men are\nnow long gone, and so is the commission, but it\nwas a good idea, though it did not survive them.\nRemarkably, just a few houses up the block from\nwhere Steve established his pharmacy, lived the\nPellegrinos, another family of St. Bernadette's\nparishioners that produced a renowned medical\nprofessional. The eldest son, Edmund, became a\nbioethicist, a \"preeminent\" one, as one\nnewspaper described him after he died. But he\nwas more. He helped develop medical programs\nat Kentucky, Stony Brook and Tennessee\nUniversities. Later, he took on the presidency of\nThe Catholic University of America. Then, after\ncompleting his tenure there, he became, as\nphysician and philosopher, the director of the\nKennedy Institute of Ethics at Georgetown\nUniversity.\nThough years apart in age, both Dr. Fauci and\nDr. Pellegrino became\nHippocratic stars, nurtured on the same block.\nOnly in Brooklyn, I say, not without bias.\nSteve Fauci was known by members of his\nextended family and friends for his personality,\nkindness, sense of humor and wit, and for telling\ngood stories. So they said in comments after he\ndied in 2008.\nTony appears to have inherited Steve's gene for\nlightheartedness. His\ndaughter once told the Washington Post that her\ndad could be a \"goofball ... he works hard and\ndoes his thing, but he comes home and he's\nsinging opera in the kitchen and dancing\naround.\"\nThat kind of calm can help a man maintain his\nbalance as he deals with the pressure of talking\nto millions of people every day about the\ncomplexity of a global pandemic.\nAs one newsman said, \"When Fauci appears on\nthe screen, you turn up the volume.\"\nHe once said the Jesuits at Regis and Holy\nCross College taught him the\nimportance of \"precision of thought and\neconomy of expression.\"\nThat's what he delivers every day: accurate\ninformation given concisely.\nThat's Tony Fauci, now a national treasure. And\nto think, he came from the neighborhood.\nDr. Anthony Fauci        He graduated from Regis\nHigh School and the\nCollege of Holy Cross.\nHe graduated number\none in his class at\nCornell Medical School\nin 1966.\nHe completed his\nmedical residency at\nNew York Hospital\nIn 1984, he became\nTOSLOW       director of National\nEAD\nInstitute of Allergy and\nInfectious Diseases, a\nposition he holds today.\nFront row, kneeling\nU.it1lc    Cr~   l\n\\ or      r-,,,.,,\nSt~\\, was on<c known as th< chmp                ut y\nsprmta   nov. he u .tl' ls H lhc cla:.; K\"~t J, . 1.-r\nA r.?guhr fellow w11h ., re3dy <n,tl~ ,1td full\not ~pun      You could ilJ\"ns count on St~\\C bt:-\n1n,: p:.•stnt .it cv~r\\· cli-,5 .tnd sdmol affair\nDisclaimer: Any third-part y material in this email h as been shared for internal use under fair use provi sions\nof U.S. copyright law, without further verification of its accuracy/veracity. lt does not necessa rily repr esent\nmy views nor those ofNIAlD, NTH,HHS, or the U.S. government.","time":"2020-04-23T07:21:00","sender":35,"cc":[],"subject":"The Tablet I find myself thinking back to his fathe r, Stephen Fauci, whose drugstore our family"}],[{"recipients":[101],"body":"?\nPleas take a look and figure out where to send it.","time":"2020-04-24T00:35:33+00:00","sender":0,"cc":[],"subject":"FW: Another PossibleTool in The Fight Against SARS-CoV-2"},{"recipients":[0],"body":"Dr. Fauci---Forgive the crude and unsolicited manner in which I am attempting to reach out to\nyou but I don't reall y KNOW any other way!\nI am not a medical doctor nor am I a principle investigator. I am just a Cytologist employed in\nthe Anatomic Pathology department at LA County-USC Medical Center here in Southern\nCalifornia.\nBut I have been read ing a lot- -- and in my own exploration I have come across several articles\nwhich suggest the possibility of using a class of agents called\nSPHINGOSINE-1-PHOSPHATERECEPTOR            AGONISTSin combination with antivirals like\noseltamivir (or perhaps Remdesivir?) to treat both the viral pathogen responsibl e for the\ncurrent pandemic as well as the runaway immune response of the host leading to the oft fatal\ncytokine storms.\nApparently these compounds have been approved for flare-ups of multiple sclerosis, and have\neven been tried on Alzheimer's patients. The commonly known drug is FINGOLIMOD. But these\npapers that I have cited for you below seem to indicate that structural analogs of this\ncompound could be important in damping down the dysregulated pro -inflammatory cascades\nwhich seem to be leading to DIC, alveolar exudates and diffuse alveolar damage, capillary leak\nsyndrome and ultimately the multiple organ failure that is killing an unacceptably high number\nof people.\nThe fly in the ointment Dr. Fauci here is that these 5-1-PR agonists have only been\ndemonstrated to be effective in non-human primates and other mammals. And much of these\nstudies on these compounds has been done not on coronaviruses but on influenza viruses .\nSo it would be a gamble. But is that not how we have learned much about human health and\ndisease is by the gracious sacrifice of our anim al cousins? And might it not be a general effect\nthat these sphingosine derivat ives have on viral sepsis so that maybe what works for influenza\nmight work for the coronavirus?\nIn the dire situation that many of the most critically ill COVID 19 patien ts find themselves, it\nseems they are on the pr ecipice of a rapid demise once they begin to show certain key\nlaboratory resu lts---(sp ikes in 0-DIMER, C-Reactive Protein, Serum Ferritin, prolongation of\nprothrombin and APTT, increased card iac troponin 1, surges in IL-6, IL-7, monocytic and\nmacrophage chemo-attractant cytokines etc) .\nW ith pat ients isolated by these aberrant lab values, the window may be narrow but it may be a\ntime where application of antiviral compounds in combination with t hese inflamma t ory\nmod ulat ors could have a striking impact on mor t ality? Indeed maybe even TWO different\nantivirals with diff ering mechan isms of action in combination with these S1-PRAgonists would\neven be better. And the possibilit ies of other combinat ions of course would be there for\nfurther exploration .\nFully cognizant of the Hippocratic Oath to 'first do no harm' I still believe that at least the\nmedical rationale is sound for the inclusio n of these agents int o the possible arsena l of\ntherapeutics for the more severe COVID 19 patients.\nPlease refe r below to t he st udies I found particularly helpful or promis i ng.

The need for platelet donations is especially acute now with the\ncoronavirus pandemic. While social distancing and increased telework are necessary to\ncontain and slow the spread of coronavirus, we have seen a marked decline in platelet and\nblood donations for our patients.\nTo alleviate this shortage, NIAID and the Department of Transfusion Medicine (DTM) are\nco-sponsoring a two-week Platelet Drive from March 30 -April 10. Platelet collections, as\nwell as whole blood and Double Red Cell donations, can only be made at the NIH Blood\nBank on campus in Building 10, Room 1(713 Monday t hrough Friday from 8 :00 am to 5:00\npm. The Platelet Center at Fishers lane is temporarily closed and plate let collections are\nnow on the main campus through at least the next 30 days. This move helps to ensure that\nblood donors are protected by visitor screening, minimizing possible exposure to\nindividuals at risk.\nWhat is a double red cell donation? A double red cell donation enables donors to donate\ntwo units of red blood cells in one visit. During a procedure called apheresis, whole blood is\nseparated through a cell separator and red blood cells are collected. The remainder of the\nblood components are returned to the donor along with saline to replace the lost volume.\nI encourage participation of all employees who are eligib le to provide a donation to benefit\nour NIH patients. I understand employees may be hesitant to participate under the current\nconditions, but I would like to reassure you that blood donation is a safe process.\nAdditional precautions have been put in place at our Blood Bank to help prevent the\nspread of infection and protect the health of donors and staff .\nThank you to all who support our quarterly platelet drives. Your efforts provide a lifeline\nfor our patients . Those who participated in the last drive are now eligible to help once\nagain. In appreciation of your dedication to helping others, NIAID grants admin istrative\nleave to any NIAID federal employee who donates platelets at the NIH Blood Bank.\nSpecifically, you will be granted 4 hours of administrative leave to be used immediately\nfollowing your platelet donation appointment. As always with such activities, please notify\nyour supe rvisor for approval prior to donating at the NIH Platelet Center .. Contractor\nemployees should speak directly to their contract companies to determine what leave\noptions are available .

We have shared it with some partners, but it is not at all clear\nhow/whether/when/how much funding might be available. Given the need to quickly expand our\nworkforce and plan ahead, it would be very helpful to get a sense of:\na. How much funding/support might be available, and how that will be determined\nb. Whether funding might come through HHS/CDC(our preferred mechanism), FEMA, or another\nmechanism\nc. Will support be available in weeks or months ...and for how long-we are strongly advocating\nfor 5 years, similar to what was done for Ebola\nd.

I've provided\nbullets below to capture the main points. Please add or change as needed. I've kept this relatively\nshort but can supply a full recording of the call if you want it.\nWe will have another call next Tuesday.\nDavid\nPPE supplies:\n- whi le hospitals are in better shape than a few weeks ago, significant shortages remain at long-\nterm care facilitates , skilled nursing facilitates , outpatient settings like doctors' offices and urgent\ncare clinics, shelters, prisons. Gowns are the biggest problem, but gloves, masks and shields are\nalso short. Doctors offices are closing for lack of PPE.\n- each city is trying to solve these shortages in a short-term , piecemeal way. They need a longe r-\nterm solution to stabilize availability. Outpatient settings are looking to health departments to\nprovide supplies , something HDs are not set up to do.\n- testing in most places still requires PPE use (e.g. no avai lability of anterior nasal swabs) and the\nPPE shortages are severely limiting testing scale up.\n- even at hospitals , supply limitations make re-opening elective surgerie s and other procedures\nimpossible at this stage.\n- If considering re-opening businesses, this will drastically increase PPE needs to a whole new\nsecto r.\nTESTING challenges:\n- Each city reported that, despite improvements, a very limited number of tests are being\nperfom1ed compared to need.\n- Supply shortages are the biggest challenge: swabs, PPE, sample kits, reagents are\nthe biggest obstacles. Not clear where this is going to come from or who is responsible\nfor addressing problems.\n- Private labs limit number of sample kits distributed each week . In places where public\nlabs are available, there is a push to get providers to use the public labs. But many\nplaces don't have public labs.\n- There is no clear guidance on how to prioritize who gets tested first. So, in some places, that\nmeans that people at lower-risk are being testing but people at greater risk (due to symptoms ,\nexposure , high-risk living /work environment, etc) are not being testing. Guidelines are needed\nto help prioritize where testing resources are used first.\n- Public testing produces skewed results . Testing becomes available only to those who\ncan make an appointment and who can drive to the site. This means many lower-\npriority people get tested but high-priority people do not. This skews understanding of\npositivity rates.\n- Some labs are underutilized - but the reason is that there are breakdowns in the supply chain\nthat make it difficult to test people and get tests to the labs. (e.g .)                    (b) <4)\n- Reimbursement is an obstacle. CMS offering to cover test costs ($100 per test) would help get\nlabs to do more testing. It would not solve the problem , but it would help.\n- Proliferation of unvalidated antibody tests is causing confusion. High rates of false results,\nmisinterpretation   of what results mean (e .g. telling people who test antibody positive that they\nmust quarantine for two weeks). Ch icago spends a lot time shutting down these testing sites as\nthey make things harder and use up supplies.\n- there is increasing pressure to reach a target nwnber of tests performed each day in order to get\nto 're-opening'. But the number needed is contextual based on the environment, population -\nthere isn't one 'right' number for everywhere.\n- Need better public messaging on difference between virology and serologic tests.\n- Current testing capacity is no where near what is needed to make informed decisions about re-\noperung.\nTESTING: reporting challenges\n- CwTent PoC tests have no link to provide results to health departments . Many outpatient\nfacili ties and SNF s have no system for repo rting test results to HDs. Need electronic link for\nreporting PoC test results.\n- While aggregate positive tests may be reported, negative result'>are not.\n- Impossible to really understand population levels of infection because ( 1) number of tests\nperfom1ed is too low and (2) not testing the 'right' people\n- Every one is pushing for rapid scale up of an tibody tests, but we still don't know what the\nresults of these tests mean and bow to apply them to policy development.\n- CDC and NIH will each coordinate sere-surveys. No details on CDC approach yet. NIH study\nis up. Still not clear how to use the results of these studies , but useful to collect data now and\napply it as knowledg e grows. Locally-coordinate aero-surveys can be helpful but only if tests are\nhighly validated .\nThe Future:\n- How many tests should we being doing? How much PPB/testings /beds/staff will be needed in\nthe coming year? Next winter, we will face dual flu and COVID outbreaks, without stable testing\ncapacity, how will we differentiate between the two?\n- What are the plans for contact tracing? Who will recruit and train? Is there a federal p lan or\nguidelines for this? How will it be paid for? What do we do to effectively isolate those infected?\nThis e-mail , and any attachments thereto , is intended only for use by the addressee(s) named\nherein and may contain legally privileged and/or confidential information .

Just last night, The\nNY Post ran a story that includes Jack among the many sports broadcasting stars that have\ncome out of Fordha                                                        CbH6);Jack and I have\nt alked about this). Thought you might like to see it. Parts of your interview are also going to\nrun on Michae l Kay's show, and Kay also features prominent ly in this piec e.\nHow Fordham has produced a generation of\nsports media stars\nApril 19, 2020   I 4:04pm I Updated April 19. 2020 I 9:16pm\nJohn Giannone , Michael Kay and Mike Breen; Chris Carrino Co urtesy of M ichael Kay, Chris Carrin o\nLong before he was an electee to the Basketball Hall of Fame , Mike Breen was an intimidated\n18-year-old freshman attending a workshop at Fordham's renowned college radio station,\nWFUV, in the fall of 1979.\nBreen felt sheepish next to the juniors and seniors leading the seminar and contemplated\ndelaying the start of his broadcasting training. Soon, a couple of upperclassmen, including future\nNBA writer Dave D' Alesandro, made him feel more comfortable.\nBut he still didn't have any friends until one day on campus he saw a confident sophomore trying\nto sweet talk a young woman. \"I know you like me,\" he said. \"I can see it in your eyes.\"\nThe woman responded by saying she would not date him if he were the last man on earth. She\nessentially was saying, \" See ya\" .. . to Michael Kay.\nThat is how Breen first became friends with Kay.\n\"For him to have the confidence to do this in front of everybody with this beautiful student , I\nthought, 'Man, this guy has a great sense of humor ,'\" Breen said.\nFour decades later, Breen and Kay are still good friends.\nMichael Kay and Mike Breen Courtesy of Michael Kay\nFordham, the private Jesuit university in The Bronx that launched the legendary Vin Scully, for\ndecades has been a powerhouse sportscasting pipeline , especially in New York. And the school\nties that first united Breen and Kay are webbed throughout the industry .\nFordham is the alma mater for the voice of the NBA Finals/Knicks (Breen, Class of 1983), the\nYankees' lead TV play-by-player/ESPN New York afternoon radio host (Kay, '82), the voice of\nthe Giants (Bob Papa, '8 6), the radio voice of the Nets (Chris Carrino , '92) MSG 's John\nGiannone ('86) , YES' Jack Curry ('86) , WFAN's Paul Dottino ('86) and YES/ESPN's Ryan\nRuocco ('08). And that's just New York-based sportscasters.\nFor good measure, the school produced CBS' Spero Dedes ('01), ESPN's Tony Reali ('00) and\nthe Washington Nationals' Charlie Slowes ('83). There are many more, and not just in front of\nthe camera. If you need a field producer, Jim Johnson ('86) works for ESPN. A radio engineer?\nWF AN's Chris Majkowski ('89) will set things up. Media relations? Louis Ban-icelli ('09) is\nleading things at MLB Network.\nLike everyone else, they are all dealing with the halt of sports due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nIt is a jan-ing timeout for people so used to being on the run.\n~\nRyan Ruocco, Mike Breen Courtesy of Ryan Ruocco\nTake Carrino, who has done so much to raise money and awareness for facio scapulo humeral\ndystrophy (FSHD), a form of muscular dystrophy that afflicts him. A fundraising event was\nsupposed to take place in March at a Ne ts game at Barclays Center. His 10th annual fundraising\ndinner, correspon ding with his 50th bi1thday, was slated for August, and now is in question.\n\"I don't know if it is going to be safe to have people together still,\" Carrino said. \"Are the\nrestrictions going to be there in terms of how many people can gather in one place? The other\naspect of it for me is: How comfortab le am I asking peop le for money when I know the economy\nand certain businesses are affected so badly?\"\nRuocco was supposed to get married in Italy in June. He and his fiancee, Andrea Ferzoco, are\nnow going to punt the wedding until June 2021.\n\"It sucks,\" Ruocco said. \"Arldrea and I were so excited and so were our guests. We have been\nfeeling all the joy leading us to this. There are people dealing with much more dire\ncircumstances than rescheduling a wedding. That is kind of the perspec tive we have tried to\ntake.\"\nWhile most of the successful sports media alumni are worried about the current direction of\nFordham and WFUV because of a de-emphasis on sports during the pandemic , to a man they say\nhow Fordham molded them and led them to where they are today.\nThey were helpe d by famous names such as the legendary Marty Glickman, a mentor , and Stan\nFischler, who taught classes. Then there were the less famous, equa lly instrwnental figures in the\nprogram, such as Bob Ahrens, who ran WFUV as its executive producer during many of these\nnotable students' formative years.\nJohn Giannone punting at FordhamCourtesy of John Giannone\nThe experiences that they shared forged many of them , such as Breen and Kay, into close\nfriends.\nGiannone went to Fordham after being recruited to be a punter on the football team. During\ntraining camp his freshman year, he quickly figured out the third-string punter would never see\nthe field. He went to Kay, then the WFUV sports director as a senior, to try to help on the station.\nKay said Giannone could do stats for him during the football season.\nKay went on to work at The Post, and later helped Giannone land an entry-level position at the\npaper. When Giannone transferred into television at CNN/Sports Illu strated, it was through a\nKay connection. And Giannone landed at MSG Network after Kay left to become the TV voice\nof the Yankees when YES Network began.\nWhen it was Giannone's turn as WFUV spo rts director, he made Papa and Curry a play-by-\nplayer and an analyst when they were sophomore s.\nWFUV also got its staff access to locker rooms at places like Yankee Stadium and Madison\nSquare Garden to learn the craft next to profes sionals at the highest level. That remains largely\ntrue today.\n\"WFUV allowed you to believe you were a profes sional broadcaster before you really were,\"\nCurry said. \"We were in the heart of New York City, and, even ifwe weren't Marv Albert, we\nfelt as if what Marv Albert was doing for the Knicks, we were doing for Fordham.\"\nThere is a lineage that unites. Carrino learned how to describe the geography of a ba sketball\ncourt from Glickman. Later , Carrino returned to Fordham and taught Ruocco the same lessons.\nThese days, at some Nets games, Ruocco is on TV , sitting next to Carrino, calling the game on\nthe radio.\nJack Curry Courtesy of Jack Curry\nPapa also was mentored by Glickman. Papa and Carrino each were told by their fathers that if\nthey majored in communications, they would have to pay for school themselves. Both ended up\nin the Business School , but had their eyes on WFUV the whole time.\nCarrino ended up working as a producer for Papa , beginning when Papa hosted a tailgate show\non WF AN . Carrino eventually followed Papa as the radio voice of the Nets.\nThe Fordham sports alums want everyone to be safe during this time -     and they can't wait to\nget back to what they love to do.\n\"I 'm desperate to get back to work ,\" Breen said. \"I'm hoping there is NBA basketball. This is the\nbest time of the year .\"","time":"2020-04-20T07:55:00","sender":79,"cc":[4],"subject":"ASF: Today's YESNetwork intervi ew"}],[{"recipients":[0],"body":"Attachme nts:                COVIDvaccine editorial_prefinal April19 wfigure.docx\nEmail below is from Larry Corey.\nRobert W.

As\nan American , a former colleague, a long-time admirer and student of your wisdom -thank\nyou . We are all safer because of you, and t he world will be a better place because of you .\nAgain.\nAs you know, I am now leading the ONE Campaign. We've been quite active w ith the\nONEWorld Campaign, dedicated to the fight against this newest virus, and focused on\nAfr ica. We've made some progress on debt, and next up is a foc us on ensuring that a\nvaccine, when it comes, is available to everyone.\nOne of the things we want to do is educate people, in all of the places we work. It won 't\nsurprise you that of particular urgency amongst our partners in Afr ica is that facts and\ninformation get to people across the continent, but we also know t hat more facts are\nneeded everywhere. So next month we are going to launch #PassTheMic, where every day\nfor 19 days we willask a celebrity to turn his or her social media channels over to an expert\non COVID-19 for one day. So Julia Roberts might turn her Twitter account to you to talk\nabout t he critical elements needed to flatten the curve and slow t he spread. Or Idris Elba\ncould give up his lnstagram to the head of the African CDCso that he can illustrate the\nimp act COVID-19 will have across Africa and what that means for the rest of the world .\nWe know artists wan t to be helpful right now, but that it is hard to know what to do. And\nwe know there are experts like you out there who have the answers. We've thought about\nthis a lot at ONE and wanted to do something we felt would truly have an impact. As we\nlook ahead we know COVID-19 does not know borders and until it is beaten everywhere\nwe are not in the clear. We need a global response plan and we need it now. By turning\nover th eir platforms for the day, celebrity influencers will be donat ing one of their biggest\nassets - their followers - to YOU, giving you the platfo rm you need (and we all need) to tell\nthe world why a global response is cri tical. Because none of us are safe unt il all of us are\nsafe.\nWe will work with each expert/celebrity pair to personalize the content to our and our\ncelebrity partners' audiences - in North Amer ica, Europe and Africa, and help create\ncontent that both parties are happy with. We are now confirming our talent part ners, and\nso far are getting a terrific response .\nWe know you're a busy man, so we've planned it so that the amount of time on your end\nwould be minimal. But the impact would be maximal.\nI'm attaching more information about the campaign. Please let me know what you think\nand if you have questions. Ideally we would like to get th is off the ground in early May, so\nare hoping to conf irm folks by April 28th at the latest.

Image captured at the N LAID Integrated Research Facility {lRf) in F01t\nDetrick . Maryland.N/A/D\nA panel of U.S. physicians, statisticians, and other experts has developed treatment guidelines\nfor coronavirus disease 2019 (COV ID-1 9). These guidelines, intended for healthcare providers ,\nare based on published and preliminaiy data and the clinical expertise of the panelists, many of\nwhom are frontline clinicians caring for patients during the rapidly evolving pandemic. The\nguidelines are posted online (covid 19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov) and will be updated often as\nnew data are published in peer-reviewed scientific literature and other authoritative information\nemerges.\nThe guidelines consider two broad categories of therapies currently in use by healthcare\nproviders for COVID-19: antivirals , which may target the coronavirus directly, and host\nmodifiers and immune-based therapies , which may influence the immune response to the virus or\ntarget the virus.\nThe panel 's conclusions about treating COVJD-19 with various agents that fall into these two\nclasses of therapies are distilled in summary recommendations. Subsequently , the document\nprovides background information about each agent-such                 as clinical data about its use, ongoing\nclinical trials, and known interactions with other drugs-that            forms the basis for the\nRecommendation. Tables briefly outline the same information.\nThe guidelines also describe the evaluation and stratification of patients based on their risk of\ninfection and severity of illness. Recommendations in this section address best practices for\nmanaging patients at different stages of infection, for example:\n• Outpatients who are either asymptomatic or who have mild to moderate symptoms and are self-\nisolating\n• Inpatients with severe illness or critical disease\nSpecial considerations for pregnant women and for children who are infected are also included.\nA comprehensive section of the guidelines addresses a range of considerations for clinicians\ncaring for the most c1itically ill hospitalized patients. This section includes multiple\nrecommendations for patients needing critical care, including infection control procedures,\nhemodynamic and ventilatory support, and drug therapy.\nFinally, the guidelines include recommendations concerning the use of concomitant medications.\nThese include statins; corticosteroids;non-steroidalanti-inflammatory drugs; and certain drugs\nused to conlrnl hype rtension, known as ACE inhibitors and ARBs.\nThe treatment guidelines panel is co-chaired by Roy M. Gulick, M.D., chief of the Infectious\nDisease Division at Weill Medical Hospital of Cornell University, New York City; H. Clifford\nLane , M.D., clinical director of the National Institute of Allergy and lnfectious Diseases,\nNational Institutes of Health; and Herny Masur, M.D., chief of the Critical Care Medicine\nDepartment at the NIH Clinical Center. Members of the guidelines panel, appointed by the co-\nchairs, were chosen based on their clinical experience and expertise in patient management,\ntranslational and clinical science , and/o r the development of treatment guidelines. They include\n30 experts drawn from U.S. healthcare and academjc organizations,federal agencies, and\nprofessional societies.\nAbout the National Institutes of Health (NIH) : NIH,                               the nation's medical research agency,\nincludes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the U.S. Department of Health and\nHuman Services.

Fauci, M .D.\nHello Dr. Fauci,\nIn the current state of medical knowledge and research in the pharmaceutical industry, there is\nno short- or medium-term solution to prevent disease or cure patients with SARS-Cov-2(COVID-\n19).\nWith this letter, I would like to make you aware of the preventive and curative potential of\nessential oils (EOs); lives could be saved.\nScient ific aromather apy: use of aromatic compounds extracted from plants - essential oils - for\nmedical purposes; 'hard' science of nature, based among other things, on in-depth knowledge of\norganic chemistry. We are not talking about perfumery or occult sciences.\nAccording to Mr . Dominique BAUDOUX,an internationally known Belgian pharmacist and\n\"a romatologist\": there is a multitude of research on the antiviral properties of essential oils.\nThe results are impressive and indisputable . Here are some viruses for which we have real\ndata:\n■   Severe acute respiratory syndrome virus SARS-Cov(it is a coronavirus)\n■   The H1Nl flu virus\n■   Avian influenza virus type H5Nl and subtypes H7N3 and H9N2\n■   The anti-infectious bronchitis virus (IBV)\n■   Herpes simplex virus HSV\n■   Dengue virus DEN\n■   Newcastle disease virus NOV\n■   Junin virus (an arena virus responsible for hemorrhagic fever)\nSource: https://www.pranarom.com/blog/guide-des-huiles-essentielles/les-huiles-essentielles-\nefficaces-contre-lecoronavirus-vrai-ou-faux : See references 1 to 28 below .\nTo add meat to the bone, if you visit the Nation al Cent er for Biotechnology Information (U.S.) :\n■ You will find nearly 225 000 references on \"essential oil.\"\nSee: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/all/?term=essential%20oil\n■   You will find approximately 22 000 references on \"essential oil+ viral.\"\nSee: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/all/?term=essential%20oil%20+%20viral\nIn addition, according to a brief email exchange with Mr. Pierre FRANCHOMME,a French\nresearcher, one of the leading experts in the field of medicinal essential oils, he informed me\nthat : a recent Indian study (March 31) highlights the potential activity of 1,8 cineo/e\n(euca/yptol) on SARS-Cov-2, as I suspected from my experience on other enveloped viruses.\nNote: the molecule 1,8 cineole is found in high concentration in eucalyptus EOs.\n■ Sharma, A.D.; Kaur, I. Eucalyptol {1,8 cineole ) fr om Eucalyptus Essenti al Oil a Pot ential\nInh ibitor of COVID 19 Corona Viru s Infection by Mol ecular Docking Studi es .\nPreprints 2020, 2020030455 (doi: 10.20944/preprints202003.0455.vl).\nSource : https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202003.0455/vl\nAnother study (2008) provided by Mr. Franchomme, shows a high antiviral activity of bay\nlaurel/leaf essential oil (Lourusnobilis)on SARS-Cov,which appeared in Nov ember 2002 in\nGuangdong province, China and which prevailed until 2004.\n• Loizzo, M.

Cough 9, 25 (2013) .\nSource: https://doi.org/10.1186/1745-9974-9-25\nConclusions of this study : The effects of Cineole in the treatment of acute bronchitis were\nclearly measurable and could be proven after a treatment period of merely 4 days. This study\ncorroborates the fact that cineole actively and significantly reduces cough frequency after four\ndays. Therefore it has been shown to have a great socioeconomic impact.\n• See also refere nce 22 below.\nAlso, according to Mr. FRANCHOMME, a clinical study on the treatment of essential oils in\npatients with COVID-19 has just been undertaken in a hospital setting (100 patients), double\nblind against placebo . I w ill kno w th e results at the same time as everyo ne else and will inform\nyou.\nHere is a summary of Mr. FRANCHOMME's analysis:\n(b) (4)\nThe scientific commun ity is launc necl in searc no f a m iradeclru g in t he basket of molecu es\nalready known for ot he r i ndicat io ns. Our design is to t rust the plant world, a great provider of\nremarkable mo lecules.\nCONCLUSION\nWe need to think outside the box of allopath ic medicine and synthetic drugs that offer no\nsolution and put pre ssure on our leaders to release funds for clinical research on the treatment\nof patients suffe rin g from COVID-19 using essential oils, as advocated by Mr . Franchomme .\nTo this end, M. FRANCHOMME confirmed to me this : / am at the disposal of your authorities\nto provide and explain a protocol based on essential oils.\nHis email address is :                                  (b)(6)\nIn terms of a double-blind placebo clinical study, there is, as of today, a huge cohort of\nhospitalized pat ients, a significant portion of whom I suspect would be enthusiast ic about\nvoluntary enrolment.\nFor pat ients in critical care with a life-threatening prognosis, it is undoubtedly possible, given\nthe circumstances , to bypass the usual research protocols and offer a last-resort treatment to\nthese patients in an attempt to save their lives, with thei r permission or that of their legal\nrepresentatives in case of temporary or permanent incapacity .\nEven if it doesn't work, I don't think patients or their loved ones will blame your government\nfor trying everything , but if you don't, I wouldn't like to be in your shoes!\nCordially,\nBenoit Ponton\nBP/bp\nCC: M.

There is a trade-off\nbetween timeliness and accuracy of the burden estimates. To provide timely burden\nestimates to the public, clinicians, and public health decision-makers, we use preliminary\ndata that may lead to over- or under-estimates of the true burden. However, each\nseason's estimates will be finalized when data on testing practices and deaths for that\nseason are available.\nFor the revised 2017-2018 estimates, we included additional information in our estimation\nregarding influenza testing practices. The surveil lance system used to estimate influenza-\nrelated hospitalizations, FluSurv-NET,collects data on patients hospitalized with\nlaboratory-confirmed influenza. Influenza testing is done at the request of the clinician, but\nnot everyone is tested and influenza tests are not perfectly accurate. Thus, the reports of\nlaboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations to FluSurv-NETare likely\nunderestimates of the true number of hospitalizations. To adjust for this, CDCcollects data\nannually from participating FluSurv-NET sites on the amount of influenza testing and the\ntype of test that is used at the site, and this information is used to correct for the possible\nunderestimate of influenza-related hospitalizations . These testing data are often not\navailable for up to two years after the end of an influenza season, and thus the estimates\nare revised when additional testing data become available . For the original preliminary\n2017-2018 burden estimates, data on testing practices during the 2014-2015 season were\nused to make preliminary estimates because this season had the highest levels of testing\namong the prior seasons for which data were available and resulted in the most\nconservative (lowest) estimates of burden. More recent data from the 2016-17 season\nshow that influenza testing has been increasing among most age groups. The current\nestimates were made using the highest testing rate fo r each age-group during 2010-11 to\n2016-17 and has resulted in some burden estimates being lower than previously\nestimated.\nAdditionally, the method we use to estimate influenza -associated deaths relies on\nadditional data from FluSurv-NH and the National Center for Health Statistics (data on\ncause of deaths and numbers of deaths that occur in versus outside the hospital) that are\nalso not available for up to two years after the end of the season being estimated .\nThe 2017-2018 estimates are still preliminary because not all of the required data are\ncurrently available. When those data become available, these estimates will be updated\nagain and the results may change.\nMore answers to frequently asked questions about CDC's influenza burden estimates are\navailable.\nDisclaimer: Any third-party mat erial in this email has been shared for internal use under fair\nuse provisions of U.S. copyright law, without further verification of its accuracy /veracity.

Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy or HBOT; first used\nsuccessfully in 1918 for Spanish Flu cases. HBOT is viable and appears to work well but\nwe do not have th e number of pressure vessels / HB chambers available to treat the\npossibly\n100,000+ who need the therap y now.\nSeveral of us in our small community have arrived at the same idea in several\ncountrie s.\nThe idea is no longer new or uniqu e.\nAgain, I am proposing use an aircraft as the pressure vessel. Every airplane with a\npressurized cabin (i.e., all commercial airline aircraft) is routinely pressurized to around\n9 psi (some go higher) while they are on the ground, as part of their norma l\nairworthiness testing.\nMyself and others have suggested that one or mor e of th e hundr eds of grounded aircraft\nbe provided to complete th e trial test .\n737 Max are not flying but are a perfect pressure vessel for the proc edur e.\nCould you help us contact Boeing, the airlines or the military?\nNo aircraft modification is required whatsoe ver so that is one of the issues off the table.\nThe aircraft remains parked on the ground with access for ambulatory patients via a\nstairway. No jetway is required unless we expand this in the future for non-ambulatory\npatien ts.\nWe would need to place stand ard DOT portabl e oxygen tank s in the cabin along with the\nassociated manifold, pressure regulator, flow-meters and tubing.\nEach patient will have his / her own anesthesia mask and breathing circuit.\nTher e is no cross contamination between patients or the cabin environment atmosphere\nas each mask incorporates a Viral Filter Kit to help protect the technicians who are also\nbrea thing from a sec ur e, clean so urc e.\nAll safety issues are addressed in the plan.\nThe same process, once proven could be utilized by our military and of course our Navy\nwho is experiencing possible outbreaks as we speak\nThe Patriot Clinic in Oklahoma City is my personal charity where we have provided over\n15,000 free HBOT treatments for our beloved vets and 30,000+    at cost or below.\nWe are not asking for money. Nor, am I selling anything in this effort. With th e help of a\nsmall group of supporters, ( Ralph Crafts & family ) my company is willing to provide\nthe equipment, training and technical support to begin the process.\nThank you for your ongoing service to our country, and thank you for reading and\nconsidering my propo sal.\nI sure would appreciate your help.\nSemper Fi!\nSincerely,\nEdward A Betts\nEdward A Betts\nANDI American Nitrox Divers International\n74 Woodcleft Avenue\nFree ort, NY USA 11520\n(b)(6)\n>http: //www .andihq.com/ <\n(b)(6)\nMatt Pottinger\nDeputy National Security Advisor\nThe ·white House\n1650 Pennsylvania Ave., NW\nWashington , DC 20502\nSir:\nAs one old Marine to another Ma rine, this letter contains the \"straight scoop,\" and is intended to\nprovide information that can help stop the spread of COVID-19, and ensure the continuity of\ncritical segments of government.\nHyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) has been in use for over 100 years, and was the only\neffective treatment for the 1918 flu pandemic. HBOT is being used worldwide to treat a variety\nof serious disease s, and has been proven to be immediately effective in treating seve re COVID-\n19 cases, with a success rate close to 100%.\nHBOT is simply breathing high-pur ity oxygen (92% or higher) for 60-90 minutes in a\npressurized environment (typically between 8 and 15psi- the higher pressure is about the same\npressure as doing a SCUBA dive to 33 feet). HBOT chambers can be 1-2 person sizes and\nportable, up to 12-seat chambe rs which are used for Navy operations.            (b)(6) I have a one-\nperson chamber in our home , and we can attest to its effectiveness in treating severe breathing\nproblems, like pneumonia , infections , and wounds.\nThe currently publicized and widely accepted statement that there is no effective treatment for\nCOVID-19 is wrong. HBO T treatments, usually just a single one-hour session, provide\nimmediate improvements in lung function, blood-oxygen levels, and organ recovery . Unlike\nrespirators, which do more damage than good and are basically a death sentence, HBO T provides\nan immediate path for recovery and healing.\nA team of ve1y experienced scientists and HBOT experts have developed a concept that will\nenable the effective treatment of large numbers of people by using some of the thousands of\ngrounded commercial aircraft as large HBOT chambers.\nI'm an old Marine Corps jet pilot , and we use our                                     (b) (6)\nso I have the professional contacts to confirm and verify the efficacy\nof the concept.\nEvery airp lane with a pressurized cabin (i.e., all airline aircraft) is routinely pressurized to\naround 9psi (some go higher) while they are on the ground , as part of their normal airworthiness\ntesting.\nWe have equipment staged and ready to go now, to treat 25 COVID-19 patients ata time- we\nneed an airplane, and we can be treating people and saving lives in about 36 hours.\nThe aircraft we need remain park ed on the ground, no modifications are needed-we will simply\nplace portable oxygen tanks in the cabin with the associated tubing , manifold, and pressure\nregulators, and each patient will have his/her own anesthesia mask.\nThere is no cross contamina tion between patients, because everyone is breathing oxygen from\ntheir own persona l mask.\nWe are reaching out to our contacts in the airlines to ask for the use of an airplane and APU\n(Auxiliary Power Unit- used to pressurize the aircraft) for a month, to treat COVID- 19 patients\nand show the effectiveness of the concept.\nWe could do the same thing with a single military transport aircraft (many of which have been\nconfigured for medical use).\nAs a Marine, and with my knowledge of HBOT, the recent death of the Theodore Roosevelt\nsailor is part icularly upsetting, knowing that a couple of Senior Chiefs or Marine Master\nSergeants could have configured an aircraft in Guam in a couple of hours and be treating all the\nsailors from the carrier.\nWe are not asking for money- my wife and I are paying for all the required equipment and\nsupport personnel.\nHBOT chambers are easily implemented and supported- you could have one in your office\n(ours is 8' long and 34\" in diameter when pressurized) and it would only take a couple of hours\nto train your corpsmen to operate it. I don' t know of a better guarantee of continu ity in the\ncurrent pandemic.\nPlease note that        (b)(6) I have no financial or political interests in the HBOT treatment\nconcept, companies , or manufacturers-we receive no benefits/rewards, other than helping to\nsave many lives.\nYou will receive a letter from Ed Betts- he's a good man, really knows his stuff, and I trust him\nwith my life- please take what he says seriously.\nThank you for your ongo ing service to our country , and thank you for reading and consid ering\nthe information in th is letter.\nSemper Fi !\nRespectf ully,\nRalph E.

The Plan prioritizes research to improve fundamental\nknowledge of SARS-CoV-2vir us and COVID-19 disease, develop diagnostics and assays,\ncharacterize and test t herapeutics, as well as develop safe and effective vaccines targeted to ward\ndecreasing disease incidence, mitigating morbidity, and preventio n mortality from this disease.\nImpact on COVID-19 Pandem ic Response: The strategic plan outlines a research plan ta rgeted at\nprevent ion and mitigation of COVID-19disease.\nOffice : NIAID, Office of the Director\nNIH Point-of-Contact : Anthony Fauci, M .D.\nNIH Point-of-Contact Email:                      (b)(6)\nAction Date : Estimated 4/17 /2020 _\nType of Action : Publication\nPotent ial for Press Coverage : Mainstream Press\nPress\nRelease\nin Development?\n:Yes\nItem 2: NIH study validates decontamination methods fo r re-use of N95 respirators\nActivity Type : Significant scientific finding\nSummary ; NIAID/NIH-funded study shows that N95 respirators can be decontaminated\neffec tively and maintain funct ional integrity fo r up to three uses. Researchers tested the\ndecontamination of small sections of N95 fi lter fabric that had been exposed to SARS-CoV-2.\nDecontamination methods tested included vapor ized hydrogen peroxide {VHP), 70-degree Celsius\ndry heat, ultraviolet light, and 70'/o ethanol spray . All four methods eliminated detectable viable\nvirus from the N95 fabric test samples. The results will be posted on a preprint server (timing\nTBD). The findings are not yet peer-reviewed but are being shared to assist the public health\nresponse to COVID-19.\nImpact on COVID-19 Pandem ic Response: Study shows that respirators could be used multip le\ntimes {2-3 times depend ing on decontamination method)\nICO: NIAID\nNIH Point -of- Contact : Vincent Munster, Ph.D., and Marshall Bloom, M.D., from NIAID's Laboratory\nof Virology are available to comment on this study .\nPOC Email:\n-------------------\nAction Date : TBD week of Apr il 13, 2020\n(b)(6)\nType of Action: Report/Publication\nPotential for Press Coverage: Mainstream Press\nPress Release in Development? : Yes\nHope you're getting some rest and taking care of yourself!\nBest,\nTara A.

Hoping that you can get this into the right\nhands, as it seems like a very promising lead in this fight .\nThe therapy, invented by Professor Claudio De Simone, has shown extremely encouraging\nresults in a preliminary trial at the Infectious Diseases Clinic of the University \"La Sapienza\"\nin Rome, Italy . Professor De Simone convinced the doctors there to start a trial on patients\naffected by COVID-19. Considering the excellent results obtained, the number of patients\nenrolled is increasing day after day. Our firm became aware of these results directly from\nProfessor De Simone, who has been a client of our managing partner, Jeremy Schulman,\nsince 2015.\nThe formulation employed in these patients at the La Sapienza Infectious Diseases Clinic is\nmanufactured in France and known as \"SIVOMIXX.\" The product is a specialized blend of\neight different freeze-dried bacteria with considerable ant iviral and anti-inflammatory\nactivity. Patients admitted to the clinic at La Sapienza, presenting as positive for COVID-19\nand with the typical symptoms of the disease, are being treated by oral bacteriotherapy\nutilizing SIVOMIXX. In each case, SIVOMIXX administration was followed by a dramatic\nimprovement in their conditions. The key takeaways are that use of SIVOMIXX correlated\nwith fewer deaths (zero in the treated group), fewer patients transferred to the ICU, and a\ndramatically reduced risk of patient intubations . The sponsors of the trial using SIVOMIXX\nare now beginning to enroll patients with severe cases who have been admitted to the ICU.\nAttached to this email is a confidential dossier about the SIVOMIXX product and a\nsummary of the ongoing study. Upon request, I am also able to send you an Excel file\ncontaining the raw data from the study, so NIH can review them, with the understanding\nthat this should be treated as \"highly confidential.\" Since the clinical tria l is continuing in\nItaly, we expect to have results covering additional patients on a rolling basis. The\nresearchers conducting the study intend to publish their results in the coming weeks.\nHowever, considering the pandemic and the lack of effective treatment options, we want\nto make NIH aware of Professor De Simone's therapy without any delay.\nSIVOMIXX is a relatively new formulation developed by Professor De Simone, currently in\nlimited commercial production at a manufacturing facility in France. Professor De Simone\nhas sufficient supply available to utilize with 100-150 COVID-19 patients immediately.\nProfessor De Simone could, on his own, arrange a small-scale supply to use with hundreds\nof additional patients in the United States. He is willing to provide his current inventory of\nthe product to the United States government. He expects that the Trump administration\ncould quickly confirm the efficacy of SIVOMIXX to significantly improve symptoms of\nCOVID-19 and reduce the duration of patient hospital stays. After that , Professor De\nSimone is willing to collaborate with the administration to bring a large-scale production of\nSIVOMIXX for use throughout the United States, Italy (where he was born), and\nSwitzerland (where he lives). Professor De Simone already has ongoing partnerships with a\nnumber of manufacturing companies, including one in the United States, for the\nproduction of another one of his produc ts (Visbiome, referenced below). With appropr iate\nguidance and instruction from the Trump administration, we believe the U.S.\nmanufacturing companies could re-tool to produce SIVOMIXX on a large scale within\nseveral weeks .\nProfessor De Simone (more information about him below) and Jere my will do whatever it\ntakes to bring this critical therapy to as many Americans as possible on an urgent basis.\nJeremy can be reached at anytime on his cell phone -             (b)(6)\nThanks so much for passing this on.\nBest,\nJake\nAbout Professor De Simone. Professor De Simone is a world-renowned expert in\ngastroenterology and the inventor of several highly successful probiotic medical foods.\nUntil 2010, he was an Associate Professor for the Infectious Diseases Group at the\nDepartment of Medicine and Surgery of the University of L'Aquila, Italy. Subsequently, he\nwas appointed Head of the Infectious Disease Department and Director of the AIDS\nCoordinat ion Group of the Abruzzi region, Italy. He is currently a retired Professor of\nInternal Medicine, still collaborating with the University, and a Fellow of the American\nGastroenterology Association . Professor De Simone's research specialt ies have been in the\nfields of immuno -pathogenesis of infectious diseases. He has published the results of his\nresearch activities in over 200 scientific articles, reviews, case reports, and book chapt ers.\nProfessor De Simone is both a researcher and a medical practitioner. He tests his\nlaboratory hypotheses in the university hospital clinic on patients w ith serious diseases. He\nwas responsible for controlling the AIDS pandemic in Italy's Abruzzi region in the 1990's.\nProducts developed according to Professor De Simone's know-how have shown positive\nresults in patients with serious diseases. One of his signature formulations , known as the\n\"De Simone Formulation,\" is now sold in the United States as \"Vi sbiome .\" The De Simone\nFormulation has been the subject of more than 70 published huma n clinical trials\ndemonstrating its efficacy in managing severe gastrointestinal symptoms from such\ndiseases as ulcerative colit is, pouchitis, and liver diseases. Concerning pouchitis, the De\nSimone Formulation is recognized by the world's professional gastroenterology societies as\na \"standard of care,\" an achievement that no other probiotic substance previously has\nattained. The De Simone Formulation became the \"gold standard\" in its therapeu ti c class.\nIts role in patient care has been endorsed in the guidelines published by the American\nGastroenterology Association (\"AGA\"), the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization\n(\"ECCO\" ), and the British Society of Gastroenterology, as well as in t he New England\nJournal of Medicine .\nSCHULMAN\nBHATTACHARYA\nJames \"Jake\" Schaller\nAttorney\nj schaller@schulmanbh.com\nwww.SchulmanBH.com\nDirect: (240) 356-9508\nCell:           Cb>(6)\nMain Office:\nThe Clark Building\n7500 Old Georgetown Road , Suite 901\nBethesda, Maryland 20814\nReceptioni st: (240) 356-8550\nFax: (240) 356-8558\nBio-Tech Corridor Office:\nThe GSK Building\n14200 Shady Grove Road , Suite 600\nRockville, Maryland 20850\nThe informa tion contained in this electronic message and any attached documents\nmay be privileged, confident ial, and protected from disclosure .

These measures included national\nlockdown , active contact tracing, isolation and quarantine . The Government of\nGeorgia appointed me to lead the National Committee on the clin ical management\nof COVI D- 19.

Some updates:\n1. ASTHOsent the attached memo t o Congress today RE: Contact Tracing Workforce calling for\n\"flexible long term and emergency supplemental funding to expand the .. . contact t racing\nworkforce\" at state, local, and related levels. It recommends against using FEMA for hiring.\nASTHOnotes tha t currently there are only 2,200 DIS nationw ide while JHU estimates that\n100,000 contact tracing employees are needed to address COVID-19 in the immediate future.\nThe memo mainly calls for 1) $3.6 B emergency funding through the CDCCrisis Cooperative\nAgreement to eligible jurisdictions, plus 2) a $4.5 B annual Public Health Infrastructure Fund.\n2. Resolve to Save Lives (Tom Frieden) is advocating for CDCto have the needed authority and\npolitical support to provide tra ining, systems, and technical expertise, while the CDC Foundation\nand ASTHO provide staffing through direct assistance to health departments .\n3. CDCcould support cur riculum development and training through the National Network of STD\nClinical Prevention Training Centers https://nnptc .org/ and/or TB Centers of Excellence\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/tb/ education/tb coe/defau lt .htm\nMy take: We share the goal of rapid ly and substantially ramping up the public health workforce and\nshould emphasize that message. It would be very challenging for any of these potential approaches to\nreach 100,000 in the short term. I don't have any special allegiance to FEMA, but their traditional role in\nemergency response is quickly hiring many thousands of workers. They are hiring now, but not at this\nspeed and scale. CDC and FEMA should have an MOU through which FEMA can hire staff and detail to\nCDC, bu t they don't seem to be pursuing. One model could be FEMA detailing staff to state and local\nauthorities to manage the hiring process. FEMA is proud of their ability to get people from \"door to\ndesk\" in one week . This would not be \"federalizing\" contact tracing or other public health activities. In\nall cases, the invitations and the oversight wou ld come from the state and local authorities, who are\nbest able to decide what mechan ism(s) work for them. Lastly, this concept includes more than contact\ntr acing. Congresswoman Susan Brooks (R-IN) in her podcast Wednesday noted that the state 211 call\nline has gone from 2,000 to 25,000-35,000 calls per day. So this concept would still have a role even if\nnot direct public health functions .\nThanks,\nPK","time":"2020-04-10T01:53:00","sender":715,"cc":[],"subject":"RE: COVID-19 Response Corps"},{"recipients":[716,717,718],"body":"Thanks Craig.

Workers would take on\nwork like tracing the contacts of diagnosed individuals, monitoring the hea lth of those in quarant ine and\nstaffing call centers . An agency such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the U.S. Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention or AmeriCorps could potentially manage the group, says Blumhorst, who\nhas been advocating for the project.

I am glad to see all you reporters sitting 6 feet from each other . I\nknow it is burdensome,       but we must work together to defeat this awful Zika . . . Rebola ...   the flu . . .\ner, what?,     ...   I mean, you know, the Coroner virus .\nSpeaking of the current virus crisis . . . boy that has a nice ring to it, doesn't it? ...   it almost rhymes\n. .. I would like to announce my pick of a running mate; Dr . Anthony Fauci, Director of the National\nInstitute   of Allergy and Infectious Disease of NIH since 1984 .. . almost twenty .. . er . . . many years\nago .\nNow before I start to answer your quest ions, let me give you some reasons for my choice .\nNumber 1: Dr . Fauci is smarter than I am, but I am ta ller and younger than he is .\nNumber 2: He is very experienced.        He has worked with many President ial administrat ions since he\ncame to Washington ...        in the 1980's as I remember . He told Ronald Reagan about the AIDS\nepidemic, advised two Bushs . . . one of them gave him the Presidential Meda l of Freedom ...            by the\nway, Ben Carson got his medal during that same ceremony, . . . where was I? Oh, yeh . . .two\nClintons .. . yes two, remember Hilary's Health Care Plan? . .. and, of course, Obama or two.\nNumber 3: He gives very good TV interviews , even on Fox News with Sean Hannity trying to mislead\nthe viewers.\nNumber 4: His medical training has given him that special skill that all physicians must have to\nsucceed - \"Always sound right,      and if you don't know an answer, make one up.\" But he is like one\nof my famous namesakes on Dragnet . . . Sergeant Joe Friday . .. \"Just the facts, Ma'am.\"\nNow I'll take your questions.\n[Sounds of shouting , general loud babbling , a baby crying , a chair falls over]\nREPORTER : \" Mr. Biden have you moved away from your promise to pick a female running mate?\"\nBIDEN : Did I say that? When was that? ...       Oh, it was during one of those debates? ...      I wouldn't\ncall it a promise. It was a statement from which I am now socially distancing myself, and that makes\nit a very timely question.   . .. This social distancing is for the pits. I haven't smelled a good head of\nhair in weeks ...   for the record, my test was negative ...   and I will ensure that women's voices will\nbe heard in my administration    by appointing several to my cabinet. Elizabeth Warren naturally will be\nSecretary of the Treasury. Kamala Harris as an experienced prosecutor would be an excellent head of\nthe Department of Justice . .. I think she is Latino too, isn't she? ...   I am not sure about Senator\nAmy Kolbuchuck from Minnesota and she has great hair, but Marianne Williamson, ...             remember,\nthe physic healer ...   could serve as Chief of the Alternate Universe     . . .excuse me, Alternate\nTherapies within HHS. Adding Senator Gillibrand to the cabinet would weigh the group too heavily\ntowards New York, since Dr. Fauci is from Brooklyn.      I will, of course, appoint Tulsi Gabbard as\nAmbassador to America Samoa.\nREPORTER : \"Do you have any concerns about any regrettable incidents in Dr. Fauci's past?\"\nBIDEN : Not really. My staff has vetted him very thoroughly. The only whiff of scandal we found was\nhis medical school yearbook picture where he was being lifted by two of his taller classmates so as to\nappear as even taller than they. None of them were in black face.\nAlso some people may have difficulty knowing how\nto pronounce his name correctly. It is pronounced as \"Fow-ch i\" with the soft \"c\" sound common to\nmany Italian names, . . . and as the Senator from Nevada I wish to say that I have many Italian-\nAmerican friends who are hard-work ing, decent citizens, but I must excuse myself from this Corleone\nhearing for another important committee meeting ...        oh, sorry ...   was I channeling the Godfather\nagain? ...    a great movie.\nThere is another small concern, since he is from New York City and his name ends in a vowel people\nmay think he is associated with Rudy Giuliani ....     but we know that he is taller than Mike.\nWe have completely debunked the New Yorker Magazine stories that Dr. Fauci has recommended\ninternal alcohol to kill the coronavirus since external alcohol really doesn't work. In fact, he only\nrecommended it as an antidote to the daily briefings of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Dr.\nFauci also noted that internal alcohol effects may be briefer t han the briefings, so viewers may repeat\na dose PRN (as necessary).\nREPORTER : \" Is it true that as noted in your background Press Release just handed out that Dr. Fauci\nwas born on Christmas Eve, and are you concerned about any back lash from Trump supporters who\nregard Trump as the Second Coming.\"\nBIDEN: Dr. Fauci is an American . Even though he was born in Brooklyn, there is no question about his\ncitizenship eligibility for this office. I think that a resurgence of the Birther Movement which was so\nviscously directed at my close friend and mentor, Barrack Obama, . . . there I final ly got his name out\nthere ...    would be very unfortunate.   Next question.\nREPORTER : \"Has Dr. Fauci made any significant contributions        in fields other than virology and\ninfectious diseases.\"\nBIDEN : Well let me tell you a down-to-earth,     fascinating story of one of his most significant\ncontributions.   It will be a short one, I promise. Since the Coroner virus pandemic has taken over all\nthe headlines, editorial pages, social media memes, political cartoons, TV shows, graphic artist shops,\nand a lot of other things swamping articles about the Opioid Deaths epidemic, Dr. Fauci has developed\na new attention -getting graphic to replace the familiar 1-10 faces of pain levels;    the 1-4 faces of\nPandemic Panic levels.\n1                 2                                         4\nREPORTER: \"But face 4 is the same        as face   2. Isn't that a confusing   message .\"\nBIDEN : Exactly\n\"Thank you Mr. Biden, and Happy April Fools Day. \"\nPS:      (b)(6) yearbook picture that won't be in the blog.\n(b)(6)\nThis entry was posted on Saturday, March 28th, 2020 at\n10:01 AM and is filed under coronavirus, current events, humor, Infectious Disease. politics.

Participants in my\nobservational, longitudinal, epidemiologic Baltimore -based study,\nHANDLShttps://handls.nih.gov/ are terrified by the level of disease they are\nseeing in their communit ies across Baltimore. We have been on the\nphone with and texting participants to educate them , support them in\ntheir efforts to get tested, remind them of the importance of social\ndistancing and self-isolation when appropriate to protec t their\nhealth . We are acutely aware of the ir fragility. Testing in Baltimore is\nlimited. The National Guard has set up community test ing at the\nPimlico RaceTrack; however , although we have deployed our mobile\nmedical research vehicles to Pimlico in the past to conduct our study,\nthe current crime rate is such that our partic ipants and community\nresidents in general do not go to the Pimlico area especially if they are\non foot. The other issue with testing for African Americans and our\nparticipants is the need to have a health care provide r that one can\ncontract to discuss symptoms to get a refe rral for testing. The\nunravelling of t he Affordable Care Act has severely impacted access for\nAfrican Americans across the nation and especially in Baltimore . Our\nparticipants are calling my staff clinician and nur se practitioner for\nreferrals if they have symptoms. We have reached out to colleagues at\nHealth Care for the Homeless, JHU and other medical entities to\nfacilitate access.\nThank you all you are doing . Since I work in Baltimore, I haven't seen\n(b)(6)\n.

Nat Geo,\nDi sney, and Bob Iger himse lf, all understand the need for discretion now but are\nwi ldly supporti ve about relea sing a film that will celebrat e the importa nce of yo ur\nlife, science and public hea lth. I wan ted th e bes t hom e, broades t distribution , and\nstrongest team for your film. You have entrusted me with yo ur sto1y, so I ju st want\nto do right by it. We are really happy wit h the filming that we have don e so far\npersonal         (b)(6) home, school) to work ( office etc) .\n3) The other film we have been working on (ENDING AIDS), which fo llows\ngloba lly the H VTN trials/latest Aids research to complete \" the too lbox\" is definitely\nstill happening. It is now in pause with COVID-19 . . .. but will move forward again\nwhen we get through this. Filming at research sites in South Africa, US, and Latin\nAmerica has been great...and when you have time - in the future- I w ill outline .\nYou obviously are a key subjec t in ENDING AIDS also , but ENDING AIDS will\nspend a lot of time with doctors at the fie ld research sites and with volunt eers in the\ntrials. The Aids conference and meetings footage we have shot wi th you wi ll be\nshared between films, smart ly and distinctly. END ING AIDS will be released a\nyear plus later than the release of your biographical film- I am focuse d on your film\nnow. Howard Hughes Medical Institute remai ns the educational pa1iner on ENDING\nAIDS. In the fall we will fina lize the broadcast/streaming partner for ENDI NG\nAIDS. So, bottom line it w ill be released a year after your film , and will be a film\nfocused on showing in detail where we are now with aids research and the key\npeople in the chain from you 10 a young fem ale voluntee r in South Africa/a you ng\nmale volunteer in Binningham.\nFILMING REQUESTS for your film now.\n4) NO more ask ing to film with the Task Force.\n5) I do have two persona l filming requests for you - wo uld it be poss ible to drive to\nNIH wi th you once or twice a week and capture your working/ap propriat e\nconversat ions in the car. That will be so helpful narratively to tracking you r\nscientific and comm unic ation leadership . The footage we did that first day is truly\ngreat. We will just tum around and come back after the ride there--- in our follow\ncar (we have NIH access badges) . Second ly, wou ld it be possible to sit down with\nyou on camera for J 5 minutes once a week (on the weekend?) at the office or on the\nback deck/some safe location to talk with me in real time about what you are\nmanaging with treatments , vaccines , etc. so we can pull the\nscientific /conunw1-icatio11nanative on COVID-19 through your film.\n6) We love the live truck and the walks, so whenever that works we will be there.\n7) l NEV ER ever want to interfere with the work on the Task Force, lives are at\nstake. IF something doesn't work for filming no questions asked we don' t do it, we\nstop, cancel/pivot.

Hang in there:\n1.)\nFauci has at times struggled to compel politicians and businesses to attack the prob lems\nthat he considers most woJTisome.Over the years, he has become especially concerned about\nthe possible impact of a lethal strain of influenza.\" True, but I almost qualified the\nstatementand said it most likely would be inJluenza, but I was concernedwith any type\nof novel respiratory virus that efficiently spread from human to human and that had a\nhigh degree of morbidityand mortality\n2.) Dyker Heights versus Bensonhurst:\n•\n•       What do we say about where he grew up.? He always says Bensonhurst.

[ the question below is the meaning of hyperactive. Does it mean producing too\nmany B cells or that they were too active, as in working too hard, producing too many\nantibodies??) Not necessarily too many B cells . It means that the B cells that are there,\nare aberrantly turned on\nHe had been investigating B-cells, which are involved in the production of antibodies.\nIn 1983-before H.l.V. was even known by that name-his lab became the first to report that\nB-cells becam e hyperactive in patients with AIDS. The virus was somehow leading its hosts\nto overproduce a defense that normally would keep them healthy. Fauci had ident ified one of\nthe crucial features of AIDS. \"We made that observation without having any idea of what we\nwere dealing with,\" he said. \"l think that speaks for sound scientific and clinical observation .\"\nThe pol itics of seeking a cure, though, would be far harder to manage.\n• 4.). This I asked before you could not speak to me but we can take me out of it. Or\ndo whatever you like: I asked Fauci if he thought that novel coronavi rus would\nforce a change in attitude among olitical lea ders and funding agencies .    (b) (6)1\n(b)(6)\n•\n5.). This you lrnve sa id in rnore than one place. People kind of became alarmed when you\nwere absent so ju st want to be sure you don't mind it in here: No problem .\nFauci said that there was nothing meaningful about his absence from the Mar.23\nWhite House briefing, \"I was tied up in a task force meeting, and we were trying to work out\nsome difficult policies and the topic of the briefing that day was more related to other\nmembers of the Task Force.

SIMONE FISHBURN,EDITORIN CHIEF I MAR 25, 2020 I 9:17 PM EDT\nA grand-sca le behind -t he-scenes effort by the pharmaceutical companies is under\nway to expedite the creation of therapies and vaccines to treat COVID-19.\nAccording to the participants who spoke with BioCentury under conditions of\nanonymity, R&D heads from at least 10 companies have been gathering several\ntimes a week, setting in motion an action plan to use their top talent in different\ndisciplines to produce an industry-wide response, the likes of which haven't been\nseen since the private sector's coordinated contribution during World War II.\nRegulatory heads and manufacturing heads have been holding meetings as well,\ncoordinating to minimize duplication of effort, streamline work and advance\nefficient testing of compounds and vaccines.\nThe R&D group is creating working principles to accelerate new COVID-19 therapies\nand vaccines agnostic to their market potential , eliminating bureaucratic and\ntechnical or scientific barriers, and focusing on filling gaps not adequately filled by\nother initiatives and which the consortium is uniquely suited to address.\nNIH-000213\nThe pharma group's leaders also intend to offer resources to biotechs and\nacademic groups pursuing countermeasures who may not want to join the effort\nbut could benefit from expert guidance.\nFlying the plane as they build it, the collaborators intend to create a clearing house\nof ideas for testing of molecu les and vaccines, with working groups to vet the ideas\nand expedite testi ng on the most promising via clinical or preclin ical testing.\nAccording to the participants who spoke to BioCentury, the structure will probably\nevolve over time. Currently, the model involves five working groups, for clinical\nphase repurposing, novel small molecule antivirals, novel antibodies, prevent ive\nvaccines and preclinical repurposing. Each will be headed by a pharma R&D\nexecutive and will be responsible for prioritizing poten ti al compounds and\nspecifying actions.\nTwo platform groups will integrate across modalities: a clinical trial acceleration\ngroup and a data sharing group.\n\"This is not a t ime to think about proprietary information or IP or margins. We\nneed to break down the barriers and solve the problem,\" said one participant\ninvolved in the consortium.","time":"2020-03-27T03:54:00","sender":322,"cc":[789],"subject":"Re: Reaching out about partnerships and COVID-19. // confidential"},{"recipients":[322],"body":"Hi Paul,\nI have done some work on the idea of an \"AMP like\" COVID project.

In addition, the measure should massively reduce transmission of other viruses and bacteria\ncurrently burdening diffe rential diagnosis of COVID-pneumonias. Based on the excellent experiences\nmade with t he acceptability and adherence during Ebola outbreaks, repeated mandatory hand hygiene\nor sanitation should thus become an almost unconscious routine of everyday life for any person having\nto leave his or her private home in Corona-affected countries.\nI have been asked by senior WHO emergency management to promote the WHO recomme ndati on for\nrapid implementation with particular focus on current COVID-19 transmiss ion epicenters such as the\nUSA.

It is abundantly obvious from the countle ss sifts through data and\ntallies of cases, interviews and press conferences, social media appearances, etc. that your schedule is\ncrazy these days. As a practicing physician and an American, I am proud to be represented by you and\nth ank you for your efforts on our behalf. I realize with your schedule and with the t housands of emails,\nt his one may not make it, but I wanted to take a shot in the dark.\nI am currently the Chief Medical Off icer of a reinsurer and am on the planning committee for the\nAmerican Academy of Insurance Medicine's annual meeting wh ich will be held in DC th is year October\n18-21. Dr. Michael Osterholm had agreed to speak at the conference back in January as ou r first\nkeynote speaker on the subject of pandemics, preparedness. I'd heard him speak before at Prudent ial (I\nwas medical director there and we were a member company of CIDRAP)and his ta lk mirrored his book\nwhich I've also read. Regretfully, 2 weeks ago I received notice from Laurel, his EA, that he is unable to\nattend the meeting because he needs to travel to London that week for a meeting he is heading. I think\nthat a talk on the topic is a must at any medical meeting and after hearing your pressers and coming to\nrely on your sage status updates and advice, coupled with the fact that the conference is in DC, I thought\nI'd give this a shot . Would you be AAIM's keynote speaker this year?\nIn the midst of the current COVID-19 pandemic, we understand many industry conferences have had to\nbe canceled. We are continui ng to closely monitor the trend of the COVID-19virus, and may have to do\nthe same for the AAIM meeting in October, but if t here is an opportunity to gather and learn, we'd like\nto prepare for it .\nThe audience is medical directors that work in the life, health, disability and longterm care space. Some\nare clinically active . Some of them are resources for health emergency planning fo r their com panies.\nThe audience comes mostly from North America, although other countries/continents are well\nrepresented.\nThe purpose of the meeting is really to illustrate novel trends in the industry that will likely impact\nmorbidi ty and mortality in the near or distant future . We've had talks on CRISPR,marijuana, precision\nmedicine, data analytics. They' re not hard core morbidity or mortality focused, but do touch on it .\nNIH-000 121\nGiven the scope of the meeting and the attendees and industries they represent, I think that a lecture\non pandemics, bioterrorism and emerging infectious disease, especially in light of COVID-19, is\nnecessary. I think you would teach new concepts to a team of doctors that would identify w ith some of\nthe system gaps in our current supp ly chain and their impact on human health, wellbeing and survival.\nYou'd provide experience and insight on what went wrong and what could be fixed in the future to make\nus collectively better prepared.\nWe would be honored to have you speak and I'm glad to continue discussion of logistics with someone\nelse on your team. If you needed more information about scope, I can certainly provide that. We do\nprovide an honorarium and will cover travel and hotel expenses.\nThanks so much in advance for any consideration you might give this request/offer and most of all thank\nyou for your direction, demeanor and dedicat ion at this global time of crisis.\nBest,\nPaulo\nPaulo Bandeira Pinho , MD, FAAP, FACP\nChief Medical Director\nOPTIMUM        RE INSURANCE COMPANY\n%                  ext. 30984\n+1 214 528-2020,\n~ Paulo.Pinho@optimumre.com\n-----------\n(8}     1345 River Bend Drive, Suite 100\n-----==\nDallas, TX 75247, U.S.A.\nc:J optimumre.com\nI-~\nOPTIMUM\n~i,     LifeReinsurance\nThis email and its attachments is confidentia l and is inte nded only for the individual(s) to whom it is\naddressed .

Who happens to be Trump's BFF.\nBefore Giuliani grew old, deranged, and more qualified to be a spokesman for Miracle Ear than the\npresident's lawyer, he was the reform -minded mayor of New York City.\nRudy rode into Dodge, which is what Times Square resembled at the time, and vowed to clean it up. His\nhand-picked sheriff was Dorchester's own Bill Bratton.\nAs police commissioner, Bratton did much to stem violent crime in the nation's biggest city, but even\nmore rema rkably got his cops to reduce the incidence of more minor , so-called quality of life crimes that\nNIH-000258\nhad made New York less livable, from the tony sections of Manhattan to the Tony Fauci sections of\nBrooklyn.\nBratton did his job too well. He ended up on the cover of Time magazine, hailed as the guy who pulled\nthe worm out of the Big Apple. He became more popular than the mayor.\nThis drove Giuliani nuts. Rudy had to be the smartest guy in the room, had to get all the credit. Sound\nfamiliar?\nSo Bratton had to go.\nThat wasn't Bratton's first rodeo. Long before he landed in New York, he became the face of\nprogressive, modern policing in his hometown, the youngest-ever Boston Police superintendent. Police\nCommissioner Joe Jordan resented his overly-ambitious No. 2 so he busted Bratton.\nThe point is, insecure bosses don't like being shown up by smarter, more competent subordinates. Small\nmen make big mistakes.\nIt may be too late to save Fauci. He just got the star treatment from Maureen Dowd in The New\nYork Times.\nThere used to be a thing called the Sports Illustrated curse, that after an athlete appeared on its cover\nhis or her career tanked.\nSimilarly, being in the Trump administration and getting praised by The New York Times is the kiss of\ndeath.\nNow, normally, you could print something in the Times and chances were the president wouldn't read it.\nHe routinely dismisses the Gray Old Lady as fake news, except when his and his family's lousy books are\nmass- bought onto the newspaper's bestsellers list. He is not fond of polysyllabic words and prefers\nto get his news from \"Fox & Friends\" or whatever wh ite national ist website his aide Stephen Miller\nmight recommend.\nBut Trump reads Mo Dowd because they have known each other forever and she writes about him at a\nnuanced, personal level that drives him especially cuckoo.\nWe're way past the theoret ical here.\nTony Fauci is in real danger, and by extension so are the rest of us who expect - nay, pray for - one\nperson in the White House to be trustworthy and competent in a time of unprecedented crisis.\nSo, again, repeat after me, Dr. Anthony Fauci is a bum.\nLong live the bum .\nKevin Cullen is a Globe columnist.

As 'survivors' are\nidentified in the general population and are determined to be largely 'immune ' to COVID-19, I think those\npeople should be given the opportunity to administer testing to others in the general population. The\nemployment of VOLUNTEERsurvivors in the administ ration of tests would allow immune individuals to\nquickly learn how to collect samples and deal w ith potential infected patients face-to-face without fear of\nj eopardizing their own health or the health of the communities in which they live. This would free up\nhighly trained nurses and doctors from testing and have an exponential benefit as survivors adm inister\ntests for infection and tests for antibodies and, thus, identify additional survivors. This would support\nmore aggressive testing to bring about the eventual end of this virus when we try to identify every last\ninfected individual who needs to be quarantined .\nNote: I understand we haven't yet determined whether survivors can be re-infected. So early volunteers\nmay be subjected to further sickness. But the rate of re-in fectio n should be less as a percentage than\nthe rate of infection among the general population. And re-infection would likely be less severe.\nNote2: Creating a VOLUNTARY REIGSTRYof survivors (those wi th suffi cient antibodies) may have a\nsecondary benefit to businesses. It would allow businesses to quickly hire employees who could come in\ncontact with the general public (thinking of current food delivery, grocery stores, daycare ...and\nlater ...teachers, anyone in the medical or dental field, other retail businesses).\nI do understand my recommendations would generate HIPAA concerns but these are extraordinary times\nwhich call for out-of-the-box ideas...and this would all be voluntary.\nThank you for taking a couple of minutes to read this and thank you for managing a very diffic ult crisis.\nYou and others on your team have saved a lot of lives and we are eternally grateful.\nRespectfully,\nFrank Estes\n(b)(6)\n-----                (cell)\nNIH-000333","time":"2020-03-22T12:30:00","sender":883,"cc":[],"subject":"Antibody Tests and Follow-on Use of 'Survivors"}],[{"recipients":[884],"body":"(b)(6)\nThank you for your note.\nBest regards,\nTony\n","time":"2020-03-17T11:17:11+00:00","sender":0,"cc":[],"subject":"RE:Recommendation"}],[{"recipients":[558],"body":"Sounds good to me.\nThanks,\nTony","time":"2020-03-20T23:47:21+00:00","sender":0,"cc":[80,228,6],"subject":"RE:Treatment Document"},{"recipients":[0],"body":"Tony,\nLooks like                                         (b)(S).

Rubenstein\nOpinion contributor\nSome viewers of the daily White House coronavirus briefings may wonder why everyone increasingly\ndefers to a diminut ive, Brooklyn -accented 79-year-old doctor, Tony Fauci.\nThey do because, as I have learned over many years of talking with and more recent ly interviewing this\nman, he is without doubt the world's leading authority on infectious diseases. In any area of human\nactivity or knowledge, there always seems to be one person who is the global gold standard. In the\nworld of infectious diseases that person is Tony Fauci.\nSo the American people - indeed, people around the globe - should be grateful that Tony has dug into\nthis crisis with the same work-around -the-clock, just-the -facts ma'am style that he has used\nwhile serving under and working with six U.S. presidents . He is as apolitical as anyone can be. I have no\nidea if he is registered with any politica l party; I suspect though that he is rabidly Independent. His only\nfocus is getting the facts out, providing the best health care treatment and information possible, and\nsaving lives.\nA top exper t from AIDS to Ebola\nTony Fauci joined the National Institutes of Health in 1968, after completing his medical training at Weill\nCornell Medical Center, and he has led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease since 1984\n- 36 years. Hard to believe anyone can run anything that long and still be at the top of his game. But\nTony is. During this period , he has dealt with every serious infectious disease challenge - malaria,\nAmong Tony's best known accomplishments, beyond simply running the institute and training dozens of\nthe world's top infectious disease professionals, has been helping to discover how HIV leads to AIDS\nand, later, leading the effort to create (at President George W. Bush's direction) the President's\nEmergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR),which has transformed the treatment of HIV/AIDS in Africa,\nand other parts of the developing world. Millions of lives have been saved by this program alone. More\nrecently, he has been an architect and powerful advocate of President Donald Trump's plan for ending\nthe AIDS epidemic in the U.S. through HIV antiretroviral therapy targeted to disease hotspots.\nNIH-000325\nIn his spare time, Tony has been involved with writing or editing more than 1,100 scholarly articles and\nseveral textbooks, and, in the process, has become one of the most cited authorities of the entire\nmedical profession.\nFor these breakthrough activities and his dedicated service (at a government salary) for more than a half\ncentury (he worked at NIH for 16 years before assuming his current role), Tony has received, and\nearned, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and a Lasker Awa rd (called the Amer ican Nobel by many).\nWith this long service and universal acclaim, one might think Tony would let it get to his head, at least a\nlittle bit. Not the case, though.\nSelfless commitment to public service\nHe is read ily accessible to those who need treatment - he still runs a lab at NIH - or need\ninformation. Tony still lives in the same house he bought when he first moved to Washington, and it is\nthere that he and his wi fe Christine have raised their three talented daughters (though none of them\nchose to attend medical school) .\nUntil the latest crisis, Tony has often commuted to NIH by Metro, typically after running t hree miles for\nhis daily exercise. And when he has been invited to make speeches in the Washington area or on Capitol\nHill, he invariably turns down a car and driver fo r the Metro. (This practice has had to change of late for\nthe obvious reasons).\nThere are, of course, many other dedicated federal servants who also view their commitment to the\ncountry and its people over financial rewards . But surely no federal civil servant, in any area, can exceed\nTony Fauci's long-term and selfless commitment to this count ry and the health of its people .\nI tried years ago, when Tony was approaching a normal retirement age, to see if he might want after a\nnormal lifetime of federal service, to take some of his considerable skills and knowledge to the private\nsector. He quickly said no - money did not mot ivate him, serving the country did. And he stayed at NIH\n- to the country's good fortune.\nIf there is any one medical professional who can help the country deal with the COVID-19crisis, it is\nTony Fauci, an example of the best this country has to offer.\nHe is not a miracle worker. No one is.\nBut Tony Fauci has the decades of experience needed to understand infectious disease problems and\nprescribe a trea t ment that should, in time, provide the requisite comfort, even if, in the short term, the\nmedicine is painful and inconvenient .\nDavid M.

Below is a better\nversion.\nRegards,\nErik\nDear Dr. Fauci,\nYou're beyond busy but I hope you read this message.\n(b) (4)\nI'm only mentioning\nthis so you don't think I'm a paranoid freak. I'm convinced you\nalready know the outbreak is way past the point of containment,\nand, unfortunately, herd immunity will soon ensue. Then,\noutbreak 2 will happen shortly after, and, hopefully, not ad\ninfinitum.\nI'm writing to make sure you already know or at least suspect\neverything I'm about to tell you. I need to clear my conscience\nNIH-000405\nbecause it's possible (albeit unlikely) that some of what tell you is\nnew and possibly useful in, at least, saving lives in the USA.\nI'm a physicist and have been modeling this outbreak since\nJanuary. My panic started minutes after I learned tvSM people\nleft Wuhan around January 22 a few days before the CCP starting\nlocking the country down. The SM peop le scattered to 13,000+\ncities in China to visit family & friends for the Lunar Festival\n(Ch inese New Year). I 've been communicating with quite a few\npeople around the world including an NYU epidemiologist           (b)(6)\n. We 've both been warning\nour families, to mostly deaf ears at first, since January. It's been\nf rustrating and exhausting, but, finally, most are as prepared as\npossible for what's about to happen.\nI have lots of information about China due to my business,\nscientif ic, friendship, and other ties with many there, including\nimmunologists & virologists at top-tier institutions and\nlaboratories . My WeChat account (like Skype / Whatapp) was\nblocked by the CCP for 3 days late February / early March, but,\nafter a warning message, it is now unblocked . I'm willing to\nshare with you everything I know, think I know, or seriously\nsuspect.\nHere are a few examples:\nI'm confident t hat China stop counting dead COVID-19 infected\nbodies since tvJanuary 7 , 2020. They'v e been add ing fabricated\ndata daily to show (to save face) the world and their own people\nan impressive flattening of China outbreak curve . It's easy to\nprove this via data analysis because, for example, improbable\ncoincidences occurred in much of the data. My suspicions were\neventually confirmed by at least two of my sources in China\n(b)(6)\n). The data posted by\n------------------\nChin a is not only garbage, it has mis led the world into a false\nsense of security wrt death rate, age vs death, and other things;\nthat is, if people analyzed the world's data including China, the\nNIH-000406\nresults are heavily biased towards nonsense, because China's\nnumber of cases accounted for the majority of cases worldwide\n(until a day or so ago).\nI want to emphasize that I do not believe China intentionally did\nthis to harm the world. I sincerely believe it was done for saving-\nface reasons. Saving face is possibly the most powerful\nmotivating force in China. it is the key to understanding how\nmost Chinese think and why they do what they do. China wanted\nthe world to believe that their Herculean quarantining efforts\ncontained the outbreak . However, I don't think this is true, even\nafter spraying ~billions of gallon of \"Clorox\" all the country. The\nnumber of body bags my contacts told me about about, even\nafter short 15-minutes walk to/from grocery stores in one city\nduring CCP-authorized time slots, suggest the number of deaths\nis several orders of magnitude larger than what China's posted\ndata indicates . Also, everyone I know in China continues to be in\nlock down ( ~6+ weeks now), and several went \"silent\" since\nabout a week ago. This greatly troubles me because those who\nwent silent live in Wuhan. And, yesterday, the CCP revoked\npermits/license for several Foreign reporters who were trying to\nlearn about about the situation in Wuhan and other parts of\nChina. Several of my sources have told me, in coded language,\nthat the situation in at least Wuhan is not under control at all. In\nmy opinion, China is continues to be extremely concerned about\nsaving face (first) and their economy (second). Their economy is\nalready suffering terribly, and they can't afford to lose the many\nlarge manufacturing and other business agreements with foreign\ncountries . This is why I believe they're trying, and succeeding to\nconvince many, to convince most of their population that the\noutbreak is under control, and it will soon be ok to return to work\n-- even though it will not be safe, because of current outbreak\nand outbreak # 2 that will likely start soon. Citizens are not\nallowed to travel beyond a few stores and, in special cases, their\nwork office, so even people who live their have no idea what's\nreally going on especially in Hubei province including Wuhan.\nAlso, an H 15N outbreak seems to have recently started in\nNIH-000407\nhumans in Hunan province (which neighbors Hubei/Wuhan area) .\nI also have lots of information      about USA.\nHere is some:\nI believe that many COVID-19 deaths were incorrectly labelled at\n2019-2020 flu deaths. The spreading in the USA is almost\ncertainly already homogeneous, because it's been going on since\nlast year without any containment whatsoever. Once massive\ntesting finally starts, this truth/reality will, unfortunately, become\nobvious. It will manifest itself as hyper exponential (hyperbolic)\ngrowth starting a day or two after the millions of testing kits\narrive and start being used . The hyper exponential dynamics will\neventually evolve to a more accurately calibrated exponential\ncurve once the number to tests is large enough to properly\nsample the population. I don't think Italy is ahead of us. I think\nwe're ahead and by a large amount.\nA few other quick bits of info ...\nThe time between infection and death seems to have decreased\nfrom about ~20 days (a few months) ago to possibly as short as\n~8 days. And, the incubation period seems to be significantly\nlonger. Both, and other data I've looked at, strongly suggest at\nleast one mutation has occurred. This is extremely concerning to\nme. Another concern is the distribution of deaths vs. age appears\nto not be as strongly biased, compared to when China data was\nincluded, towards older people and/or people with chronic health\nconditions.\nOver the past 15+ years, I've traveled to China multiple times\nper year. I'm pretty sure you've known this for a while, but I\ntruly believe the outbreak tsunmai in the USA is either already\nhappened or is about to happen. As you know, as soon as a\nsurge is sensed, the Tsunami will immediately follow. I believe\nwe missed the containment boat quite a while ago. I've been\nNIH-000408\nclosely listening to your comments on TV, and I'm pretty sure\nyou've already come to the same conclusion but don't want to\ncause mass panic (I understand that).\nI'm 99% sure that SARS-CoV-2 been spreading in the USA since\nlate November / earl v December last year.                 (b)(6)\n(b)(6)\n---(b)(6)She works at                                      (b)( 6) and\nit's possible that everyone in her office got infected too. Who\nknows how many people in Alaska got it too, but I suspect many\ntens of thousands possible much more.                             CbH6)\nbut it has been impossible to get\ntested. I've called 5 places in Alaska and none wanted me to\ncome it for the test.\nI've instructed my family and, recently (after family), close\nfriends to get some Alvesco ( ciclesonide) for emergency use\nonly. I've been told by colleagues on the front-line in Japan,\nChina, and Korea, and found several pre-pr int papers, that it is\nan effective treatment for late-stage COVID-19 patients. Some\npatients on ventilators who were approaching death have fully\nrecovered after treatment with ciclesonide; ciclesonide has much\nsmaller particles than other corticosteroids so it reaches deeper\ninto lungs and alveolis) . Also, the treatment seems to be a\npotent suppressor of virus replication. Recovered patients have\ntested negative shortly after the treatment. Of course, data is\nlimited so can't be sure the treatment is effective. However,\nbecause Alvesco has been shown to be safe for infant - 100+\nyear-old patients, I'm ok with my family and I having it for\nemergency use. That is, only if healthcare facilities are unable to\naccept them or me as a patient to treat with ventilator,\nNIH-000409\ncorticosteroids ( or whatever the best available treatment is at\nthat time). Having Alvesco in our emergency kits is a much\nbetter option that someone avoidably dying because of an\noverburdened healthcare facility. The other drug I have, and\nhave told my family and some friends to get, is called\nhyro xychloriquine -- also seem to be effective and safe. But , I\nthink Alvesco is better because it appears to prevent the virus\nfrom replicated so infection is wiped out and no longer\ncontagious. Alvesco seems to be two silver bullets in one.\nI don't believe in coincidences and I'm not a conspiracy theorist,\nbut there are many things out of Iran that also concern me\ngreatly . That's all I say right now.\nIf all of this is old news to you, then I would greatly appreciate a\nresponse. It can be as short as \"yes\". Anyway, I had to share this\ninformation with you. Now my conscience is clear . My concern is\nthat it's possible you don't have some of the above info, so I\ndecided to send you this message .\nI wrote this quickly, so I apologize in advance for any typos,\netc .\nI truly appreciated your efforts, and I'm now confident that\nPresident Trump, you, and everyone else involved is doing\neverything possible to ensure the best possible outcomes.

Another\ngreat doctor in China is Dr. Nanshan Zhong.\nAccording to Dr. Zhang's video at https ://www. thepaper.cn/newsDeta il forward 6537248 ,\nCOVID-19 can really be prevented with 3 key measures, i.e. to keep social distancing , wash\nhand s frequently and wear masks.

My family are living in          now. I have been following\n(b)(6)\nspread of COVID-19 (Corona Vims) closely because such virns is very contagious and\ndangerous.\nIf a person is mildly sick with COVID-19 , the CDC now suggests the person shou ld \"stay home\nexcept      to      get     medical      care\",    i.e.     home-isol ation,   according      to\nhttps ://www.cdc.gov /coronav irus/2019-ncov /downloads /slck-with- 2019-nCoV-fact- sheet.pdf\nHowever, the home isolation may result in family spread of COVID-19 in certain kinds of\nfamilies, e.g., parents are infected but their kids are too young to take care of them, adults are\ninfected but their parent s are too old and risky to look after them (if they live together) , an old\nhusband /wife is infected but the spouse is too vulnerable to take care of him/her, etc. In such\nscenarios, the home isolation may increase family spread and even comm unity spread risks in the\nus.\nA great method to avoid home-isolation risks is the concentrated isolation, i.e. to isolate\nmild symptomatic people in a concentrated place instead of thefr homes.\nThe concentrated isolation can avoid the above family spread risks, provide professional medical\nhelp to isolated people, reduce menta l pressure of other family members, etc., so that it can\nreduce community spread risks. Such method has been proved to be effective by China's war\nagainst COVID - 19.\nThe conce ntrated place can be a hotel , university dorm building, etc., which should be easily\nmanaged for medica l surveillance.\nNIH-000466\nThe concentration isolation may be voluntarily chosen by relevant families at the beginning, and\nadjusted to apply subject to different conditions.\nHope the above advice helpful!\nBest regards,\nMichael Liu\nNIH-000467","time":"2020-03-16T08:14:00","sender":928,"cc":[],"subject":"Great advice from Chinese expert"}],[{"recipients":[79],"body":"I will write to or call Mark and tell him that I am interested in doing this.

We also have a good example, China, in which\nvery aggressive measures have been applied and, despite some delay in their application at\nfirst, they now have reached a strong regression in the virus spread and they gradually can\nrestart the country. China measures were to close every city borders, close working places and\nevery non essent ial activity. They asked the population to stay at home and go out only for food\nand health emergencies. I think th is is what we should do in US too.\nA recent study from Italy in which they tested every person in one It alian city showed that the\n50-70% of the peop le positive for the virus were asymptomat ic. This is such an impor tant\ninformation that tells us the only way to prevent the spread is to prevent the people from\nmoving because we cannot really know who is caring the virus.

I am asking that you take a moment to listen to Fareed Zakaria's show\nthat was aired today, Sunday, March 15, 2020, at\n(https://www.cnn.com/shows/fareed-zakaria-gps        ). Please listen to the message\nand review the attached chart that was presented on Fareed's show. This is NOT\nabout politics, but instead the people. Therefore, let's call to action that the United\nStates of America government officials and leaders call for a mandate similar to\nother countries, such as China, Italy, and Spain (i.e., now, New York & Illinois) to\nhelp reduce the spread of this virus, flatten the curve, reduce the inundation to our\nhealthcare system, (which is about to experience the worst morbidity and mortality\noutcomes), and work to save lives.\nThere are too many unknowns for us to continue to go on as status quo. Let's be\npublic health officials and petition to mandate the US Administration to move to\naction - by putting in place a Mandatory Shutdown of Movement throughout this\nCountry.\nCurrently, we have approximately (9 airports in the United States) in total chaos,\nwhich will be another wave and spread of this virus. We are not proactive; instead,\nwe continue to react late. This is not the public health that I know and have seen\nthroughout the duration of my public health vocation. We have to change this\nPandemic, so let's get to work.\n#Cry for Pubic Health Action Needed -----****We need this\nAdministration/Government Committee to LockDown the United States of\nAmerica.

We're writing to ask\nyou to consider spearheading an additional initiative in this effort.\nAs you know, one of our greatest immediate needs is an adequate supply\nof ventilators for use in hospitals . We will face a severe shortage of this crucial\nequipment during a surge of COVID-19 hospitalizations. This will creat e a bottleneck\nin our ability to de liver care , a situation where we have to triage who should\nlive and who should die .

I completed my training in\nOtolaryngology at the University of lowa in 2019. From 2013 to 20 I 5, l did a research fellowship with Dr. Stanley\nPer lman , an expe rt in corona virus , to study SARS. Before I came to the States, I was an ENT doctor and had\nworked in the epicenter of the COVID- I 9 outbreak, Wuhan, China for several years. Many of my friend s, neighbors,\nand colleagues were infected . Some of them have died or are dying. I truly appreciate what you have done to wake\nthe Americans and warn them about this dangerous virus outbreak. J hope we arc not repeating the mistakes that the\nChinese and Ita lians have made earlier.\n>\n> I know many physicians and nurses who have been on the frontlines against this coronavirns outbreak in Wuhan\nChina. Over the past a coup le of months , I have been communicating with them about the COVID-19 ou tbreak. T\nhave obtained much firsthand information about this virus from medical professionals, including the ICU directors\nof major hospitals in Wuhan. Here l want to share some thoughts with you and hope that I can help prevent the\nworst in the USA .\n>\n> For the government:\n>\n> I. Close all public school s immediat e ly. My family is in          (b) (6). They are yet to decide if they should close\nthe schools after the spring break . This is one example that has concerned me a lot. In the email from the          (b) (6)\nSchool Distr ict, quote: \"there are many factors to be considered any time a decision is made to close schools. These\nfactors range from eva luating the consequences of missed instruction to providing meals to students who rely on the\nschool's food service program \", this is extremely short -sighted . These factors, as quoted above, will be very minor\nissues and easier to handle, compared with the potential catastrophic consequences should the virus outbreak be out\nof control and have para lyzed ow· already -overwhelmed medical system in the USA. I hope the foderal government\ncan issue an administrati ve order to close the public schools.\n>\n> 2. Cance l or postpone any large gathering events more than 20 people. Use tele-conference if necessary.\n>\n> 3. Every county in this country should have contingent plan in place and have one or several isolation\nfacilities/temporary shelters in the remote areas using co!Jege dorms or hotels, in preparation of future large\noutbreaks ofCOVJD-19 in the community.\n>\n> 4.   Work with local or state media to inform the pub lic oftbe status of basic life necessity (e.g. food, water, tissue\npaper) and essential med ical supplies (including PPE). If there is a shortage, the estimated back-to-stock timeline\nshould be provided. for PP Es, if the shortage cannot be so lved within a short period of time, they should be saved\nfor those who truly need them includ ing medical professionals treating patients with COVID-19. All local medical\nsupply businesses should tum in their inventories since the State Emergency has been declared. These timely\nupdates will provide assurance to the public to avoid panic and chaos.\nNIH-000570\n>\n> 5.   Encourage online shopping and drive-thru pick-up including groceries. Help the local businesses to expand\ntheir delivering capacities.\n>\n> 6. Provide the public live updates on the outbreak , including the number of confinned cases , their curre nt\nclinical status, strategies of tracing their close contacts , as well as the number of tota l cases being tested. From what\nT have learned, the more transparent the government is, the less panic the public will be.\n>\n> 7. Issue laws that prohibit intentional spread of COVID - 19, irresponsible behaviors that put other innocent\npeop le or medica l professionals at risk of contracting the virus.\n>\n>\n>\n> For medical professionals :\n>\n> Early January in Wuhan, many patients very likely contracted CO YID- I 9 in the local hospita ls when they visited\ntheir physicians for other medical conditions. In addition, the medical system in Wuhan China was almost paralyzed\nat that time. One of major reasons is that many medical professionals were infected and sick. The medical\nprofessionals are the backbone in the fight against this vims outbreak . We need to prepare for the worst scenario that\nthis outbreak can last for a few or several months. We need to protect om medical professionals first.\n>\n> I. Set up a centralized Fever/COYID-19 hotline operated by trained provider/nursing staff. This telephone line can\nuse the current available state infom1ation hotline , with expanded functions serving as a gatekeeper and triage\nmechanism for potential COVID-19 patients to receive guidance on where to seek help before visiting a busy clinic ,\nan urgent care , or a hospital emergency room to minimize the chances of cross-infection and over-whelming large\nmedical centers.\n>\n> 2. Establish designated Fever/COVTD- 19 clinics or hospitals led by well-trained ID teams (MD , NP), especially in\nhighly populated areas. These clinics will serve as the secondary triage and referral centers for the aforementioned\nFever /COVTD-19 hotline, plus for primary care clinics that are not equipped with adequate staff and testing tools .\nThese clinics should have adequate staff including physic ians and middle level providers, equipped with testing kits\nto perfonn COYID -19 test on site. They should have the capacity of testing drive-through patients , securing airway\nfor ventilation if needed before transferr ing severe patients to tertiary medical facilities. They should be operated\ncollaboratively with larger healthcare systems like U Iowa , Unity Point , and Mercy who are setting up their own\nisolated COVID-19 centers for more severe cases.\n>\n> 3. Establish a clear conunun ication and transfer protocol between Fever/COVID -19 hotlines, clinics and treating\nhospitals for management of suspicious and confirmed cases. For those with mild COVID-19 infection, they should\nbe self-quarantined at home and monitored closely and remotely. If they cannot perform self-quarantine safely, such\nas living by themselves or in nursing homes, they should be kept in the county isolation facilities (as mentioned\nabove), being monitored there.\n>\n> 4. If drive-through testing is available at CVS or Walgreen , patients with positive results should call the hotline or\ntheir PCPs first if clinically stable to receive guidance for self-quarantine , monitoring and follow-up. If they cannot\nperform self-quarantine safely , they should be kept in the county isolation facilities as mentioned above.\n>\n> 5. lnform the public and other healthcare providers of the availability of these Fever/COYID-19 hotline and\nclinics, encouraging patients with symptoms to utilize these resources first before visiting clinics , emergency rooms\nto reduce the chances of cross-infection , and the burden on large medical centers.\n>\n> 6.

Can you please make\nsuggestions/add itions/correct ions?\nThanks so much!\nJon\nThe World Health Organization has declared the Covid-19 outbreak to be a\npandemic -- official recognition that the virus respects no borders and now\naffects masses of people in countries all over the world. And there is no\ndenying the world is changing, in painful ways . We see it in financial\nmarkets, where prices are plunging -- and in supermarkets, where\ncustomers are stripping shelves bare. All driven by fear , as the number of\nvirus cases grows with each passing day. While we may feel powerless over\nthis threat, we are not. There are important things we can and must do --\nand right now .\nTo borrow a phrase from the war on terror, the coronavirus only has to be\nright once to infect us. We have to be right every time to prevent it. So, every\ntime you cough or sneeze , use a tissue or the crook of your arm. Every time\nyou think of it, wash your hands -- as frequently as you can. Every time you\ncan, practice \"social distancing\" -- stay away from others during this\noutbreak. Social distancing is now being enforced throughout our society.\nSchools are closing, sporting events of every kind are being canceled. The\ncurtain has even come down on Broadway shows as the Great White Way\ngoes dark.\nDespite our best efforts , it's likely many of us will eventually get infected by\nthe virus , since we have no immunity to it. If that's the case, you may ask,\ndoes it really matter when we get infected? The answer is a resounding\nyes! And here's why: slowing the spread of coronavirus -- and consequently\ndelaying infections -- can make an enormous difference in our ability to\nhandle the pandemic .\nTake a look at this illustration. It appeared in the Economist and is based on\na CDC report . The blue curve shows what happens when you do nothing .\nThe number of infections peaks relatively quickly. This can overwhelm a\nhealthcare system that is not prepared to handle such a huge number of\npatients. Emergency rooms and hospitals can become overloaded. We may\nsee shortages of medical supplies -- including protective gear and breathing\nmachines -- and shortages of healthcare workers, especially if many of them\nbecome infected. But look at the yellow curve. It shows what can happen\nwhen you slow the epidemic. The outbreak is stretched out. And while it may\nlast longer , the peak number of infections is much lower, putting less stress\non the healthcare system and allowing better care for each patient. It also\ngives scientists more time to develop new treatments and vaccines .\nNIH-000574\nIs there any evidence this works? Absolutely, especially when coupled with\nthe time-proven technique of aggressive testing to find and isolate infected\npeople as early as possible. In China , where there has been strict quarantine\nand social distancing in the epicenter of the outbreak, new infections have\ndramatically slowed. In South Korea, where health officials cleverly used\ndrive-through testing, we' re also seeing the number of new cases slow\ndown. And there 's a history lesson from the 1918 flu pandemic . Back then ,\nPhiladelphia held a parade attended by several hundred thousand people.\nSoon , every hospital bed in the city reportedly was filled with sick patients .\nSaint Louis , on the other hand , practiced social isolation and saw fewer\ncases.\nSo we have work to do, and it won't be easy, because it means changing the\nway we live our daily lives and how we interact with our neighbors . And we\nhave to start now -- when we can make the most difference .\nAnd here's something we need to keep in mind. We are all in this together.\nSo even as we keep a distance from each other physically , we need to stay\nclose emotionally. Social isolation is bad for your health! If ever there was a\ntime to call or video chat with friends and loved ones. And don't forget to\nreach out to the elderly --who may be alone and afraid.\nDemonstrating grace under pressure is easier said than done. But that is this\ndoctor's prescription for getting through this . And , if we treat each other with\nkindness and empathy, we will.\nJonathan LaPoo k, M .D.\nChief Medical Correspondent, CBS News\nProf essor of Medic ine\nNYU Langone Health\nPLEASE NOTE: IF YOU LEAVE ME A MEDICAL MESSAGE AND DO NOT\nHEAR BACK WITHIN 24 HOUR S, PLEA SE CALL MY OFFICE AT 646-754 -\n2000 .

I didn't know if your old email still worked, so I'm using the directory listing by NIH in addition. I\nhave some ideas to share with you about the use of tools in the current war on covid-19.\nYour 'close the bars' statement is right on target with what I was writing when I heard you say it . It was a\ngreat illustration counterintuit ive to what will work . You could have more correctly said keep the bars\nopen on ly to those in their twenties and thirties. Five minutes later Mayor DeBlasio said everything is on\nthe table including closing bars and restaurants! Below you will see me argue why there are better\napproaches and this total closure approach is the wrong move. Selective participation will work in our\nfavor to blunt the curve! Total closure will not work and can wo rk against us!\nIn a period of two weeks demand for medical treatment can go from 50% of hospital capacity to 200%\ndue to disease progression and binomial expansion. You know the math and ideas, so there's no need to\ngo into them. There is a need to closely consider how available tools are being used to mitigate an\noverwhelm ing of the health care system. I can tell you now that what needs to be done isn't being done\nand that the road we are on now will at most postpone crossing the threshold of 100% capacity. It will\nnot achieve the desired result of distributing cases over a greater time period so that being\noverwhelmed is avoided .\nConsider the curves:\nThe ' with out protective measures' curve is the normal distr ibut ion as modeled by the binomial\ndistribut ion. The 'w ith protect ive measures' distribution is what we want to achieve, although that\nwould be fore ign to an exper imenta list. We don't want the number of cases to exceed capacity as\nindicated by the horizontal dotted line. If the 'protective measures' are social distancing, school closings,\nentertainment/sporting cancelations, restaurant closings, and hygiene and similar uniformly applied\nmeasures, the 'with' curve should have a shape similar to the 'without' curve, just shifted to the right,\nunless there is some unpartitioned factor interaction. The flattened curve WILL NOT RESULTbecause\nerrors should be random and SAMENESSOF TREATMENTPRODUCESSAMENESSOF EFFECT.With\nUNIFORM application of measures the curve afte r application will still exceed a height showing the\nsystem capacity has been exceeded .\nNIH-000579\nWe could expect to flatten the mesokurtic 'without' curve into the platykurtic 'with' curve by systematic\ntime staggering in the use of the protective measures and selectively apply ing the measures to drive\ntoward herd immunity. As immunity builds toward HIT (Herd Immunity Threshold), there will be greater\nand greater slowing of infections as the linkages for transmission decrease. There are two points to\nconsider here.\nThe first point is whether measures should be applied in a uniform and blanket manner. The answer is\ntypically no when the effect is on an existing population because the curve won't flatten. There are two\naspects of the application of measures to consider. Is the effect of the application defining the\npopulation or is it an effect within a defined population. In the instance of halting all air traffic to the US\nfrom China, the population is being defined and altered if influx is allowed and that would both increase\nthe infections and population turbulence. There would be movement away from HIT. Any measure such\nas people influx, which moves the US away from HIT, is to be avoided.\nSchool, restaurant, and sporting event closings need to be examined in relationship to their impact on\nan existing, not an increasing population . The actions have many criteria to influence them, but from the\nviewpoint of keeping the healthcare system from becoming overwhelmed closings that are staggered,\nvariable, and alternating will work to increase movement toward HIT and promote flattening of the\n'with' curve.\nThe second point to consider is whether we can move the US toward HIT by age selective application of\navailable measures. The answer is yes and this could provide the best tool. Susceptibility and strengths\nof covid-19 infections covary with age. People less than 30 rarely have severe infections and the younger\nones may not become infected. People under 40 show a low frequency of severe infection. It will be\nimportant to know if there is a large age cohort exempt from infection because that would undermine\npart of the result from selective app lication of measures or limit the sampling age because these people\nwouldn't develop immunity , but might contribute to delaying herd effects. If they develop immunity\ntheir contribution can be substantial and they can be kept separated from more vulnerable people until\nand unless it is established that there isn't a need.\nOpening night clubs, sporting events, restaurants, and other places to people in their twenties and\nth irties will build immunities, break infection transmission links, and move toward HIT with little or no\nrisk to the people or the rest of the herd. Have admission to the venues by existing ID, like a driver's\nlicense with age, and have agreement that they do not mingle with vulnerable older people. Leaving the\nbars open to people in their 20's and 30's will flatten the curve!\nNIH-000580","time":"2020-03-15T01:44:00","sender":959,"cc":[],"subject":"Tools that may help you"}],[{"recipients":[6],"body":"This is the first that I have heard anything about this subject.","time":"2020-03-15T18:32:34+00:00","sender":0,"cc":[],"subject":"RE: [EXTERNAL  ] CNN question/German vaccine company?"},{"recipients":[0],"body":"Do you know anything about this?\nSent from my iPhone\nBegin forwarded message:","time":"2020-03-15T01:38:00","sender":6,"cc":[],"subject":"Fwd: [EXTERNAL]CNN question/German vaccine company?"}],[{"recipients":[960],"body":"Thank you for your note\nA.S.

Effective Immediately until 4 MAY 2020 (or further\nnotice) - ONLY Key and Essential federal employees of all agencies (IC included)\nshould repo1t to work. Eve1yoneelse is on administrative leave. While buildings are\nempty, staff remaining should conduct deep cleaning (air systems, etc.) to ensure a\nhealthy environment when employees come back to work.\nPha se 2: Federal recall: Be ginning 4 MAY 2020, federal employees are called back\nto work on an as-needed basis (indefinitely) depending on how the virus\ntrends. Excluding postal workers, that accounts for nearly 2 million full-time\nemployees. There should be a mandatory home-quarantine so people are not out\nspreading the disease.\nPhase 3: Mitigation and recovery. Federal agenc ies need to produce mitigation\nmeasures (crisis action plans) should something of this nature occur in the\nfuture. F ederal agencies must be ready to respond in an organized manner when a\ncn s1soccurs.\nThroughout this COVID-19 event, military and law enforcement must have an\nincreased presence to prevent mass hysteria and mob mentality. Increased military\nand law enforcement presence may help enforce the home quarantine measures and\nprevent looting and other crimes that tend to occur during crisis events.\nNIH-000589\nThe National messages may include the following:\nThe top priority is the safety and security of the people\nWe will make decisions based on health guidance and current conditions here and\nelsewhere\nWe will get through this together (share resources , express kindness etc.)\nWe need to care for each other - It is vital it is to unite around this crisis\nAs a Nation , we need to come together as a conununity to survive this international\ndisaster\nThis health crisis is challenging each of us to make sacrifices and implement\nchanges out of the norm.\nUltimately , this crisis is not about us.

It\nseems to me that trying to contain the virus as we are doing at\npresent will be futile. Since the virus can be present for many days\nwithout a person having any symptoms, you would literally need to\ntest everyone at the same time to determine who has it--an\nimpossible task .\nI have a different thought. We know that the virus is\nespecially dangerous for the old and/or immunosuppressed. IMO\nwe should be focusing all of our efforts on keeping that group from\nbecoming infected. To do so that group should be encouraged to\nself-isolate, to limit their social interactions and other groups should\nbe instructed to avoid them. Sort of a reverse-quarantine idea. All\ntesting would be done within those groups and all groups would also\nbe encouraged to continue with the hygien ic suggestions they've\nalready received .\nThe problem right now is that the media has created a panic. Last\nnight my wife and I went to the local Whole Foods and many of the\nshelves were empty and healthy younger people were wearing\nmasks .\nThe message is not getting out that the virus is almost solely\ndangerous to the elderly and immunosuppressed. [Why aren't the\ndemograph ics being released? That in itself could calm many\npeople.] With my suggestion, exposures to them would be\ndiminished, significantly reducing the number of deat hs, as well as\nNIH-000624\nthe potential impact on hospitals. Any person outside of that group\nthat was severely affected could be identified and\ntreated. Quarantining otherwise healthy people outside of those\ngroups who finally demonstrate symptoms--like the NBA players--is\nridiculous. They are likely to get the sniffles and have also already\nspread the virus. As long as they're not spread ing it to the\nendangered group we should not worry about it.\nIn sum, we need to isolate the vulnerable and realize that the\nmortality rate for people outside of that group is likely lower than the\nflu.\nOf course , while this occurs we are working on finding treatments\nand vaccines. But sending home workers who have next to no\nlikelihood of being significantly impacted by this virus is\nridicu lous. The virus hits hardest the old and infirm , two groups that\nare most likely NOT to even be in the workforce!\nTo me, this solution is a lot simpler than what is being tried right\nnow and is much more likely of success. To everyone besides the\nendangered group this virus is literally less dangerous than the\nflu. There is no reason that anyone outside of the endangered group\nshould have any concern at all and we need to make that\nclear. Please let me know what you think.\nSincerely ,\nMichael Betts\n(b)(\nNIH-000625","time":"2020-03-14T13:15:38-04:00","sender":0,"cc":[],"subject":"Re: Coronavirus response"}],[{"recipients":[982],"body":"Thank yo u for your note.\nA.S .

Your entire expression has changed\nalmost like when I bumped into you in the Washington Metro after you had gotten off\nthe plane with President Bush.\nI have an interesting question regarding pneumococcal polysaccharide immunization.\nOne of our staff members phoned. Her father is a physician in France and has many\nphysician acquaintances. She was told that the doctors believe that the older patients\nwho received pneumococcal vaccine have less of a mortality than those who did not get\nthe vaccine.\nWhen we did the studies and got the pneumococcal vaccine approved for the elderly in\n1976 there was a battle about who should get it and whether was cost-effective. Since\nthen, other studies have documented the benefit, especially in older people and you\nprobably have received it. It is now routine but I know many elderly individuals have\nnot gotten immunized. Historically, many, if not the majority of deaths from influenza\nin some of the past epidemics was a result of secondary infection with pneumococcus.\nI'm not hearing anything about urging people to get immunized with pneumococcal\nvaccine. The message would need to be clear so they don't confuse pneumococcal\nsecondary infection with primary coronavirus infection.

Healthcare systems are thus\nable to maintain important contact with these populations and recommend targeted escalation of care when\nneeded, while decreasing exposure to both clinicians and other patients.\nThe public perception of the lethality of t his globa l pandemic is fueling panic wh ich, in and of itself, is creating its\nown logistic issues that are already beginning to overwhelm hospita l Emergency Departments.

As you might be aware, we have been running an inf luenza transmission study\nin Seattle for the last 2 years. This involves at-home testing fo r ILi-symptomatic individuals (who log-in\nvia a web app) and collection of nasal swabs, which are then sequenced for a range of respiratory\npathogens . Dan can give you more details on this study if you have questions. When the Coronavirus\nsituation arose, we added t his to the list of pathogens and hence were able to detect some of the early\ncases in Washington.\nThe CDChas been very interested in the approach and at one point we had the highest screening\ncapacity in the US (though only 400 samples per day, so I hope this is no longer true). At the same time,\nwe have developed a COVID-19 at-home screening and information system with robust software that\napproximates what China was doing but also takes into account the opt-in requirements that are\nnecessary in the US.\nWe want to propose going beyond the Seattle area- this would be gated only by availability of testing.\nWe can deploy this ready-now system more broadly in the US. Ideally we would also do a parallel\noutreach to some African countries.

Instead, effect ive treatmen t or amelioration of the worst complications is\nnecessary. 1nthis spirit, I have an idea that was spurred by a letter in Lancet last month authored by Al Benevolent\n(attached ). In this com munication they suggest that baricitinib (Oluminant ; a JAK1/2 inhibitor regis tered by Lilly\nfor the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis ), using in si lico techniques . might be useful in the treatment adva nced\nCOVID - 19 pneumon ia/ ARDS identified . Baric itinib could possibly blunt the cytokine storm seen in the most\nseverely affected patient s via inhibiti on of JAK 1/2, but also decrease viral en try in AT2 pulmonary cells and\nmy ocard ial cells via inhibition ofGAK and AAKI. It is has a relatively short plasma half-life and hence could be\nmo re useful than Roche 's tocilizumab / Actemra). Baricitinib has a good safety profile although as a drug to treat\nautoimmunity it is fonnally contraindicated in patients with infections, this could be offset by treatment patients\nwith anti-viraJs such as Gilead's remdesivir, etc. Perhaps you folks have already thought about/discus sed its use bu t\nif not J' d like a chance to chat about my additional thoughts.

There are plenty of instructions about getting prepared, but all seem to point towards\nwaiting until there is an outbreak in one's community to do anything substantial, which seems if you'll\nexcuse my language, ass-backwards, as one you see multiple cases, you're likely to already have\nwidespread community transmission .\nI think this piece by Bill Hanage at Harvard explains where a lot of us are right now :\nhttps ://www.washingtonpost .com/outlook/co ronavirus-test ing-united -states/2020/03/0S/a6ced5aa -\nSf0f- llea-9055 -5fal2981bbbf story. htm l\nStay well, we need you more than ever (and I mean that from the bott om of my heart).

Attaching his manuscript, unde r review with NEJM. Vincent is available at         (b)(6)\n-      if you need him.\nHow the experiments were done:\nAerosol -A solution of live virus was made and aerosolized in a rotating drum (kee pi ng it in aerosol\nform) ; at various time point s, air was removed and amount of virus measured (using end-poin t titration\non Vero cells).\nSurface - A base solutions of live virus was made and placed on specific surfaces (plastic, etc) and at\nvarious time points, coating was taken away and virus contained was titrated.\nNote t hat surface experiments with proteinaceous material (e.g., respiratory secretions) are underway,\nas are variations in relative humidity and temperature.\nHow do you interpret aerosol data?\nDecay in aerosols occurs over three hours, so if the virus is aeros ol ized (via aerosol-generat ing\nprocedures or cough), the moment it drops below a certain threshold, it would be hard to get an\ninfect ious dose/infection. Of course we do not actually know the infectious dose, which limits our abil ity\nto give firm guidance based on this data.\nNIH-000815\nHow do you interpret the surface stability data?\nCopper seems to have some virucidal effect, as is seen with other viruses. Plastic and stainless steel\ndon't have much of an effect on the virus itself, and the virus persists for some time. As for cardboard,\ndifficult to interpret because the surface absorbs a good deal, but there is some immediate decay.\nShould we be concerned about packages based on your data?\nThis is of far lower concern than droplet and other fomite transmission. Typical shipping wil l allow ample\ntime for viral decay, and the card board itself seems to have some direct effect on the virus (either\nthrough absorption or other effect) . For example, in the experiment, Vincent applied\nlOeS viral particles/ml and it drops 2 logs to 10e3 immediate ly, ind icating that either due to absorption\nor direct effect on the virus .\nOf course, if a mail carrier coughs on a package and then someone touches it directly after, there may\nbe a risk. The typical shipping situation is likely not a concern.\nWhy are SARS-CoV-2 vs. SARS-CoV-1 different?\nFor the cardboard data in particular, there is a difference seen between SARS-CoV-2and 1, which is\nlikely due to error/variation in surface.\nNIH-000816","time":"2020-03-07T03:40:00","sender":82,"cc":[101],"subject":"Stability data - spoke to Vincent."}],[{"recipients":[33],"body":"","time":"2020-03-08T14:30:13+00:00","sender":0,"cc":[],"subject":"FW: A Coronavirus Deterrent?"},{"recipients":[0],"body":"(b)(6)\nWould the use of a facial steam inhalator cause nonviability of the virus in someone who had contracted\nthe virus?\nWould spending time in a steam room have a similar effect?\nNIH-000817","time":"2020-03-08T10:13:00","sender":1042,"cc":[],"subject":"A Coronavirus Deterrent?"}],[{"recipients":[240,228,6],"body":"Attachments:          COVIO19linee guida trattamento 0lMAR.pdf .pdf .pdf\nThere may be nothing to this, but we shou ld at least be aware.","time":"2020-03-08T14:29:44+00:00","sender":0,"cc":[],"subject":"FW: Hazardous use of Remdesivir in CoV-19"},{"recipients":[0],"body":"(b)(6)>\nDear Dr Fauci,\nI am copying below a let t er I just sent to the ed itors of Lancet and NEJM t hat I th ink you should\nalso read.

Many schools\nbrought back students from study abroad before the 14 day quarantine was put\ninto place, and even after the quarantine was put in place, many students did not\nfollow the quarantine rules. Also, with shared dorms and apartments it was not\npossible for student's who returned to campuses and not their homes. By the times\nschools came up with a plan for quarantining the student's it was well over a week\nafter some were back. Therefore, there is potential for widespread infection.\nThe vice president said the elderly and those w ith underlying medical conditions\nare at risk and should take caution in where they go, avoid crowded places\netc..Millions of students have asthma, diabetes, auto-immune disorders, and they\ndo not have a choice other than to go to class. The government does not seemed\nconcerned about the potential spread among campuses and what a disaster this\ncould be. They have voiced why grade schools are not closed (since younger are\nnot at risks better for them to be at school) but they are ignoring college kids are\nat risk and the impact of widespread infection on a campus could be huge.\nStudents i~      colleges travel back and forth to the city all the time , and I am\nconcerned schools are not temporarily closing until more testing is available and\nwe see where this goes. At minimum , giving student's with underlying medical\nconditions the option to go home and work remotely. Right now they do not have\nNIH-000870\nany option other than to go to class. When questioned they say they are listening\nto the CDC and state government.                                             (b)(6)\nand students are not following the advice to stay home sick and nobody seems\nconcerned about trying to prevent infection.\nCan the government please look at a temporary ban on classes at Universit ies in\nstates where infection is rapidly spreading, especially knowing there are not\nenough test available yet. The schools are not taking action on their own and this is\na frustrating situation seeing delays in decisions making.\nThank you for your time in consideration in addressing these concerns,\nPrefer to remain anonymous for the protection of                          (b)(\n----------\nSent from Mail for Windows 10\nNIH-00087 1","time":"2020-03-07T11:19:16-05:00","sender":0,"cc":[],"subject":"Fwd: universitycoronavirus"}],[{"recipients":[292],"body":"Sorry this is from patty.

I am a pediatrician in Massachusetts,\nand as you know , direct-linkage           from travel cases are\npopping up on the East Coast. In order to keep the\ncommunity viral load down , keeping new cases from\nmoving around the country and the world will delay\nthe spread and amplification of the vira l\nload. According to my observations, hot climates\nseem to be having a favorable new case rate . Based\non the city of Qom versus the experience in\nSingapore and Australia, it appears that the transit ion\ntemperature for efficient spread is somewhere above\nwhen there are highs around 50 degrees F, similar to\nH1N1 . According to my observations, prior to\nseasonal flu , the transition temperature was closer to\nhighs of 40 degrees F. This theory should be\ntestable . For example , there are new cases in Kuwait\nand Bahrain. If I am right , if you tested a subset of\nthese populations , you would find a very high rate of\nasymptomatic infection , probably 80-90%, because\nthat's how many people it would take to shed small\namounts of virus to create a community viral load to\nmake someone sick enough to get tested. If this is\ntrue , this bodes well for the virus burning itself out to\nendemic status relatively quickly. This would be very\nreassuring data you could provide to reduce panic - if\nyou can tell people you know how long this pandemic\nis going to last rather than saying that we don't know .\nAlthough some experts may say that restricting travel\nw ill on ly delay the inevitable, this is not a valid\nstatement if the transition temperature for effect\nspread really is 50 degrees. A delay of significant\ncommunity spread in the US until highs reach the 50s\nfor the Northeast where the population is the most\nNIH-000874\ndense would have a massive life-saving effect , but if\nthis is to occur, the flight restriction needs to happen\nnow.\nStopping all flights would be impractical and\ninhumane, but allowing return flights only and\nstopping all other air travel would be effective . It\nwould have a massive effect on the economy, but so\nwill overwhelming corona virus infection. No one will\ndie because they can't take a vacation or business\ntrip . Financial losses would need to be settled later,\nso this would require emergency declarations , etc. If\nyou wanted to take it in a step-wise manner , you\ncould start with international flights and then move on\nto domestic flights if necessary - this would probably\nbe wise and would have a less severe impact on the\neconomy.\nThank you again, and I am sure this is one of\nthousands of unsolicited emails .

While not doubting the reality of this genetic\nvariability , best observed in an orderly manner in the case of HIV, I considered the\npossibility that these pathogens are endowed wiith an immunosuppressive capacity\nthat is not inactivated during vaccine production, and that current vaccines do not\ninduce immunity against such\nimmunosuppression. I applied this reasonning when I work ed on an AIDS vaccine in\n1991 in Zagury's lab\n(Halbreich A et al. (1992) Vaccine Research,4 :397-412 ). Indeed , we tested then , in\nsuitably immunized animals , the effect of the various preparations on the cellular\nresponse to tuberculin and the capacity of animals to be\nImmunized against tuberculin and tetanus as a function of the exrent of treatment. The\nimmune response to these agents was indeed higher in the presence of hivions\ncompared to heat inactivated preparations . This HIVION preparat ion was used on 6\npatients in Zaire (Zagury et al. ( 1992) J Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes,\n5 :676-681).\nNIH-000890\nUnfortunately, when I tried to make a greater prep for a phase I trial , the viral preparation\nturned out (too late) ,\nby SOS gel elecrophoresis , not to contain any viral protein , due either to degradat ion or\nanother mishap . I left Zagury 's lab soon after and it was impossib le for me later to obtain\nmaterial (either viral or from recombinant protein) to further advance the matter. I do\nbelieve that tuning vaccine preparation to counter immunosuppressive effe ct of the virus\n(parasite) while preserving its capacity to induce anti viral immunity should resolve the\nneed to revaccinate every year against the same virus. In fact, identifying the epitopes ,\nacting for immunity and those\nacting against immunosuppression, at a later stage should allow a better result than we\nobtained. (It is not yet known whether corona virus also mutates rapidly, but I heard that\na woman was reinfected after having recovered from covid-19 infection and this might\nindicate a capacity of the virus to counteract the host's immune response.\nIn                               H 6) I have been itching ever since to go back to\nCb\nunfinished projects , but did not\nfind an avenue.

My early academic research (refe rence\nprovided, PNAS)involved cancer immunology where it contributed to a growing body of info rmation that\ncertain tumor cells could possessunique surface antigens that could be used for immunologi c therapy\n(https://www .pnas.org/co ntent/pnas/7S/12/S9 12.fu ll.pdf ). My career then too k me to executive and senior\nexecutive/corporate officer positions in publicly-held pharmaceutical corporations (Glaxo and Salix,\nrespectively) overseeing R&D of therapeutic agents. My experience has included both pharmaceuticals and\nbiologics.\n(b)(6)\nOur current understanding of COVID-19 mortality is that it appears to be concentrated in the elderly and\nthose with underlying medical conditions. In healthy indiv iduals (although still early) it appears that many of\nNIH-0009 11\nthose infected with SARS-CoV   - 2 may remain symptom free or develop mi ld disease, or recover from mo re\nsevere illness. Currently there are te ns of thousands of individua ls who have been identified as having been\ninfected but are considered 'recovered' . That being case it wou ld seem plausible that they have mounted an\nantibody response to the vir us.\nThe question is whethe r these individua ls are being tested for ant ibody titre to the virus, and if that is\noccurring whethe r they are being approached to donate plasma to move into lglv prod uction. With this\nillness still in it s early stages and being international, I would imagine that such an effort would involve a\npublic/private sector endeavor. Understanding the difficulty in developing a vaccine fo r 'cold viruses', lvlG\nmay be a way to at least reduce the mortality in our most vulne rable patients . So, the slow start we have had\nin t esting the US popu lation for this virus goes beyond disease prevention - it would certa inly be affecting our\nability, to some degree, of rapidly developing a more ta rgeted intervention for high risk patients .\nAgain, you may have already thought of this, but as a concerned citizen having some background and an\n----------           (b)(6) ,I wanted to share these thoughts .

As much of our medical supply\nmanufacturing in the US comes from overseas , it is of critical import to look at\npotential shortages of key product s that will be needed to perform basic IP functions\nin you r facility . We have already seen challen ges with N95 masks, and I have heard\nabout potential shortag es of items like disinfect ion wipes . We at MPI have a couple\nof uniqu e solution s you need to consider:\nPureTabs and PureOne NaDCC tablets that are diluted in tap water to create HOCl for\nsurface disinfection. They are currently used in electrostatic spraye rs to offer greater\ncoverage around your equipme nt. If, for some reason , there's a challenge getting the\nelectrostati c spray ers in the future (and we've already seen shortages and delays in\ngetting new units), simpl y use our NaDCC tablets with spray bottle s from your local\nstore to apply the HOCl for disinfection. Our tablets have kill claim s for C. diff in\nfour minutes, and like a number of other cleaning agents , we believe we can be\neffectiv e against the Novel Coronaviru s. The prob lem with the other products out\nthere comes down to availability, particularly of the N95 masks that are required on\ntheir IFU's. With our product, an N95 mask is recommended, but not required, which\nis a huge distincti on if you have run out of N95 masks.\nSecondly , we have our protective scrub s, lab coats and privacy curtains from Prime\nMed ical. Co-branded with Clorox, these products create a 3 log (99.9%) barrier\nagainst bacteria and viruses when washed with bleach. The barrier lasts for 12 weeks,\nNIH-000926\nso there's a dramatically lower chance of passing something along. These are a great\nprotective measure for your staff. The CDC mentioned that sodium hypochlorite\n(bleach) may be effective against Novel Coronavirus, so it stands to reason that our\nscrubs will help against unwanted spreading as well.\nFinally, we have our Path-0-Wrap, which protects mattresses and gurneys from the\nharsh chemicals used during cleaning. It also can help dramatically when a\ncatastrophic event happens, as you simply put these on a gurney or mattress and\nremove them between patients. It was invented by an EMT for just this purpose , and\nmay be exactly what you need for your Emergency Preparedness Program.\nWe also have other great IP products such as:\n• UV Disinfection Boxes to create a \"touch-less check-in\" to protect staff and\npatients alike\n• HealthySo le UV solutions for the bottom of feet for OR and other sensitive\nareas\n• Bowman Cover Your Cough Stations\nI have attached a couple of brochures for your review. We can provide you with a\nquote, or have our local representative bring in samples of some of the products to\nshow. Simply write me back with what you would like more information on.

However, we are now being\ncontacted by sources at tertiary academic hospita ls with CUA-high complexity clinical labs who are\nalarmed about their inability to scale up SARS-CoV2 qRT-PCRtesting in t heir facilities in the time frame\nthey feel is neccesary, even after Saturday's FDA regulatory guidance and the availability of Integrated\nDNA Technology 's testing reagents. (An example of such an email is below.) I am passing th is along with\nthe hopes that if you can do something about it , you will. From an email:\n\"We have experience bringing up laboratory deve loped tests. We have never submitted an\nEUA before. For our current LDTs, they are typically for pathogens that we have some\nexperience with, positiv e clinical samples are readily available, and/or appropriate control\nmaterials (e.g. bact eria, viral genomes) are read ily commerc ially available. None of those\nare true for SARS-Co V2. There is tremendous concern about deploying a suboptima l test\ninto a challenging envirom11ent.\nThe EUA guidance from FDA is not unreasonable for the validation of a new respiratory\nvirus test, and it gives an accurate picture of the amount of testing that is required to bring\non a new test by the lab. Federal law requires us to perform accuracy , reproducibility,\nanalytica l sensitivity / LOD, and analyt ical specificity (cross reactivity) studies. Those\nstud ies require pos itive contro l mater ial includingintact v irus or RNA. Clinica l labs are not\nprepared to generate RNA transcript , and we don't usually source these ourselves. We\ncan't get the virus without filling out extensive paperwork that requires multiple\nsignatures. Getting control material for validation one of the biggest issues .\nNIH-000949\nPrior to the EUA change, the calculus for our labs was that it would take 3 to 4 weeks to\nactually validate a test, and then we would submit to the FDA for EUA (a process non e of\nus has ever done), and then we wou ld wait for the FDA to respond (hopefu lly in the\naffirmative). I think we all expected the FDA EUA review to be at least 4 weeks. Based on\nthat time-line, many commercial vendors would have reagents available with their own\nEUAs that would be able to be performed on large automated instruments including\npotentially STAT. None of the LDT assays (or CDC assay) can be performed STAT or on\ndemand.\nWith the EUA change, the proc ess to va lidate the test is st ill the same and will still take 3\nor more weeks. Once validated, we can perform clinical testing (like any other LDT) while\nwe submit the EUA. This would likely allow us to begin testing several weeks before\ncommercial vendors have EUA reagents available based upon our best current\ninformation. Most of us expect to transition a commercial EUA at some point.\nThe recent statement that IDT reage nts can be used under the EUA from CDC is\nmisleading. It applies to a very limited number of lots ( cunently 1, likely 2 soon), it\nassumes reagents are available, and it requires strict adherence to the CDC protocol using\nidentical extraction methods (2 choices) and amplification/ detection methods ( l\ninstrument). It still specifies the use of an Nl, N2, and NJ reactions, but CDC has dropped\nthe N3 reaction . The EUA has not yet been updated. Neither of our hospitals have the\ncomplete extract ion or amplifi cation instruments so we have to do the EUA anyway.\"\nHope you are coping ok,\nJames\nJames 8.

Others have been plying with and\nmodify ing the notional conops for a healthcare system.\nI set up some simple rules :\n1. Protect uninfected patients and staff from infectious patients and\nstaff (using all the tools that we have includin g home isolation and\nhome quarantine , cohorting/physical separation, PPE, telehealth,\netc.)\n2. Provide acute care for COVID pat ie nts (cont inuum of ER-inpatient\ncare-intensive care)\n3. Support mildly ill COVID patients in home isolation --telehealth\n4. Support patients in voluntary home quarantine- -te lehea lth\nNIH-001475\n5. Continue to address the usual mix of healthcare needs for patients\n(from outpatient care to acute care to mental health care to long\nterm care)\na. Outpatient clinics and providers focus on wellness to\nminimize ERvisits/hospitalization to unburden the acute\ncare system-leverage telehealth\nb. Continue to provide acute care and inpatient mental health\ncare (continuum of ER-inpatient care-intensive care) for non-\nCOVID conditions\nc. Protect high-risk patients in residential/long term care\n(n ursing homes, hospice, long term psychiatry, etc.)\nThe notional conops divides the healthcare system into hot and safe\nareas. The hot area is only acute care: ER-acute inpatient care-ICU\ncare. The safe areas include a separate acute care area (ER-acute\ninpatient care-ICU care), all the outpatient clinics/care, other inpatient\ncare areas such as mental health, as well as long term/residential care\n(nursing home, hospice , long term psychiatry, etc.).\nTriage will not be easy (between hot and safe). Best I could come up\nwith would be: ( 1) anyone already on home isolation or home\nquarantine (may need a medical record flag); (2) anyone with ILI (could\nnarrow that down with a negative rapid flu test); (3) anyone with a sick\nhousehold member with suspected COVID. Could be very difficult for\nan unconscious /confused, or trauma patient etc., but would probably err\non the side of hot and think of additional layered strategies to minimize\npatient risk within that area (private rooms, patient PPE?). Triage\nwould need to err on the side of keeping the safe area safe.\nThe mitigation measures are our best tools to reduce community\ntransmission and reduce the probability of an infectious patient getting\ninto a safe area. If we have a breach in a safe inpatient area, it pretty\nmuch converts that inpatient area into a hot area. That also means that\nwe have the staff in that area exposed (because of limited availability of\nPPE, the staff in the safe area would not be PPE-PPE would have been\ndirected to the staff in the hot area). Those staff would likely need to be\nplaced on quarant ine. The effect is we now have a much larger hot area\nwith even fewer staff. That would really be a mess.\nNIH-001476\nYou have the same problem in the outpatient areas. Have a sick patient\nslip through and come in contact with a number of the clinic staff (not\nin PPE), and we now need to quarantine all those staff. In contrast to a\nbreach for the inpatient area, the outpatient area can still operate as a\nsafe area (just minus those staff who would now be on quarantine). But\ndo that a few times and pretty soon you have nobody left to fight. One\nway I thought about dealing with this scenario is to take the outpatient\nstaff and split them in two. One group works the clinic (physically\npresent) for the usual clinic hours for a 14 day stretch (1 incubation\nperiod) . Another group works from home (and practices social\ndistancing, etc., really acting as if they are on home quarant ine) and\nleverages telehealth technology to care for patients and help with\nmonitoring those patien ts in home isolation and home quarantine. After\n14 days the groups switch. [All along we monitor employees daily\n(whether at work or at home) for symptoms or sick household\nmembe rs] In the event of a breach , the groups immediately switch and\nthe group that was working is placed on actual home quarantine (but\nstill continues to work from home leveraging telehea lth) . That way if a\nbreach does happen, we have a fallback response (that we are constantly\npracticing) that allows us to sustain outpatient care.\nFor the inpatient areas, I thought about the lone survivor model (holding\nback 1 Secretary and staff in the event that the government is\ndecapitated). So think of a small group (would need to think thru what\nthe composition of that team would look like for each area (acute care,\ninpatient mental health, long term care) that would at least provide the\nnucleus of the expertise necessary to reconstitute the service in the\nevent of a major breach). This smaller group would vary in team\nmembers every 2 weeks and would rotate to work from home for 14\ndays stretches and pract ice social distancing (acting as if they were on\nhome quarantine). They could also assist via telehealth (inpatient\nconsultation , etc., while out of the hospital).\nIs anyone thinking along these lines (really continu ity of operations for\nthe healthcare system)?\nSent from Mail for Windows 10\nNIH-001477","time":"2020-02-21T10:02:00","sender":1079,"cc":[780,670,1078,1081,1082,1083,1084,1085,1086,1087,1088,1089,1090,1091,1092,1093,579,1094,1095,1096,1097,1099,1100,1101,1102,1103,1104,1105,1106,350,240,767],"subject":"RE: Red Dawn Breaking , COVID-19 Collaborative, Feb 16 start"},{"recipients":[1080,535],"body":"https: // www.cbc.ca/news    / canad a/ ottawa /d iamond -princ ess-coronavirus-\ntr enton-comw all-l .54 70386\nCanada flies home passengers from cruise line .\nData in article :\n47 of 256 Canadians contract\nhttps://protect2.fi reeye.com/url?k=96ebd7bc -cabfcec0 -96ebe683-\n0cc47adc5fa2 -\n16a39afbe c00c653&u=https ://www.t imesofisrael.com/israe l ... nee-\nd iagnosed/\nIsrael confirms first coronavirus case as cruise ship returnee diagnosed\nOne of 11 Israel is who arrived in the morning after quarantine aboard\nDiamond Princess ship tests positive, after entering 14-day isolation at Sheba\nMedical Center\nTrying to track cruises ship passenger /crew by country (data is sketchy)\nTotal    ICU\n%\nCountry          Passengers/Crew         Confirmed Admissions Deaths\nInfected\nCases\nus                   434                 58        l?               13%\nNIH-001478\nHong Kong                  330\nCanada                    256                  47                                  18%\nAustralia                241                  48                                  20%\nUK                     78                   6                                  8%\nIta ly                  35\nSouth Korea                 14\nIsrael                  11                   1                                  9%\nJapan                                                                      2\nSubtotal                1,399                 160\nTota l                3,711                634                                  17%\nSent from Mail for Windows 10","time":"2020-02-21T08:35:00","sender":1079,"cc":[780,670,1078,1081,1082,1083,1084,1085,1086,1087,1088,1089,1090,1091,1092,1093,579,1094,1095,1096,1097,1098,1099,1100,1101,1102,1103,1104,1105,1106,350,240,767],"subject":"RE: Red Dawn Breaking, COVID-19 Collaborative, Feb 16 start"},{"recipients":[1080,535],"body":"China ha s again mod ified its reportin g (first it added clin ical cases to\nlab confirmed cases on Feb-12).

As a conseq uence, would expect much the same results.\nI listened to the discussion yesterday. After listening to James and\nMichael describe the conditions on and around the cruise ship, I\nwondered whether anyone in healthcare leadership ( outside the\nexpert ise at our biocontainment facilities) is thinking about infection\ncontrol practices for any staff entering areas of a hospital caring for\nCOVID patients (like changing clothes before entering and perhaps\nwearing scrubs, not bringing personal items into the area like iphones,\nipads, stethoscopes, white coats, purses, briefcases , etc .)? And\ninstituting policies that require all patients to phone for clearance to\nenter prior to presenting at safe acute and non-acute areas including\ncommunity based clinics? Are we confiden t of the infection control\npractices of acute care staff (that they know the basics of how to don\nand doff PPE and behavior while in PPE?) Would HCWs in outpatient\nclinics or long tem1 care facilities be any better prepared than the crew\non board the cruise ship or the responders in Japan? I'm no expert in\ninfection control and would defer to the expertise in this group. I was\njus t a little smprised how little this seemed to be a concern for the\nhealthcare leaders gathered yesterday.\nI think we are getting close to the point where we need to drop those\nthings that are not critical and focus on the most imp01tant things.\nWe are going to have a devil of time with lab confirmation - it is just\ntoo slow (they had a 2 day turnaround on the cruise ship) and we just\ndon't have the capacity for the volume of tests we would anticipate.\nCharity has stressed this point again and again. That means we are\ngoing to have to fly blind early on. Perhaps the best we are going to be\nable to do in the near term if things begin to acce lerate is screen all\nsuspect cases (pretty much anyone with ILi symptoms) with a quick flu\ntest and assume anyone who tests negative is suspected COVID until\nproven otherwise; and treat everyone who tests positive with Tamiflu.\nIt will prove problematic early on, but as the epidemic barrels along,\nCOVID will displace everything (at that point we will just assume that\nanyone with a fever or ILi has COVID). The problem is in the\nbeginning . It is going to be so hard to sort things out. Matt, James and\nothers are pushing for more rapid screening- but we ju st aren't there\nyet. The consequence is that we will be placing patients with resp\nillness (that is not flu and presumed to be COVID) in areas with actual\nNIH-001493\nCOVID patien ts. I hate to do that, but not sure how it could be avoided\nearly on. But we wou ld only do that for those who are ill enough to be\nhospitalized. The large number of asymptomatic and mildly ill patients\nwould be under home isolation (so no worries about mixing confinned\nand suspected patients). The downside is that we would have larger\nnumber of people is isolation and home quarantine than is really\nnecessary (and the consequence of increased workplace absenteeism).\nAnd it is because home isolation and home quarantine are so important,\nhealthcare systems (and not ju st public health) have to grab a hold of\noperationalizing those NPi s with both hands. A while back, I created\nsome prescriptions (tongue in cheek), just to underscore that physicians\ndo have a role in isolation and quarantine (it is not limited to public\nhealth). We might not have pharmaceutica ls available to treat COVID,\nbut why can' t we write pre scriptions for non-pharmaceutica ls? I don't\nthink healthcare leaders appreciate this point. Every COVID pat ient we\nadmit or see in the ER will require us to follow up with household\nmembers to make sure they know to home quarant ine (need to do the\nsame anywhere in our system we find a patient who is infected). You\ncould not imagine the pushback I have received when I proposed that\nwe must have an active role-people seem to think that state and local\npublic health is alone respons ible for this. I would think public health\nwill be overwhelmed and taking charge of this is our best strategy to\nkeep our safe areas safe.\nI would be interested to hear how other healthcare systems and public\nhealth leaders are thinking about this.\nSent from Mail for Windows 10","time":"2020-02-20T07:15:00","sender":1079,"cc":[780,670,1078,1081,1082,1084,1085,1086,1087,1088,1089,1090,1091,1092,1093,579,1094,1095,1096,1097,1099,1100,1101,1102,1103,1104,1106,350,240,767],"subject":"RE: Red Dawn Breaking , COVID-19 Collaborative, Feb 16 start"},{"recipients":[1080,535],"body":"Keeping track of the outbreak aboard the cruise ship.

As a\nconsequence we began a deep dive\nto better understand the sch ool\nenv ironme nt (includi ng the\nNIH-001570\ntransportation system half the\nschool age kids use each day) and\nschool age kids. An unsung hero\nin all this was Lisa Koonin (who\nwas at CDC at the time). If\nRichard birthed TLC, Lisa kept\nthe baby alive in the neonata l\nICU.\nWe still have much to learn about\nthis virus. Thus far, it seems to be\nsparing kids (just like SARS). We\nhave been monitoring the reports\nfrom Ch ina as we ll as the detailed\ndata we can see from Hong Kong ,\nSingapore , and Japan - the\nnumbers of kids remain very low\nand disease appears to be mild.\nNonet heless, TLC (and the NPis)\nis focused on reducing disease\ntransmission (effective ly\ndecreasing Ro )- the interventions\nare rea lly agnostic to sever ity. It is\nwhy CDC had to scale the\nimplementation of TLC (later\ncalled CMG) to severi ty. Despi te\nthe abse nce of severe disease in\nkids , we really are still in the dark\nin tem1s of the amount of\nasympto matic disease or mild sub-\nclinical disease in kid s becau se we\njust haven ' t been able to look.\nI never forgot this gra ph of the\ndata from Bob Glass and the\ninflection point that was observed\nwhen the combo of closing\nschools and social distancing of\nkids was imp lemented in his\nmodel. Although closing schools\nnd\nis complicated by its 2 and 3     rd\norder impacts , it is actua lly a\npretty clean intervent ion in tenns\nNIH-001571\nof actually pulling the trigger\n(much cleaner than the other\ncomponent s ofTLC) . If this\noutbreak proves to be as severe as\nour initial estimates, we should\nthink long and hard before\ndismi ssing the early\nimplementation of th is strategy\n(closing schools and social\ndistancing of kids).\nSent from Mai l for Windows 10","time":"2020-02-17T09:59:00","sender":1079,"cc":[535,1078,1082,1083,1086,1088,1089,1091,1092,1093,579,1096,1099,1100,1101,1102,1103,1104,1105,1106,350,240,767],"subject":"RE: R ed Dawn"},{"recipients":[1080,1081],"body":"Breaking, COVID-19\nCollaborative, Feb 16 start\nN Pi s are going to be central to our\nresponse to this outbreak\n(assuming our estimates of\nsever ity prove accurate).

The data that was\ngathered back in 2006 on socia l\ndensity in var ious environments\nNIH-001573\n(homes , offices /workplaces,\nschools, daycare , etc., is\nunchanged) . For additional\nbackground and context, we\nattached are 3 papers on NPis and\nTLC for those who are interested.\nRichard Hatchett deserves full\ncredit for birthing the idea of TLC\n(it was actually developed in\nresponse to the threat of HSN 1 and\nlater adopted for pandemic\ninfluenza response). Duane,\nperhaps you can store these\ndocuments on MAX for safe\nkeeping and access?\nThe first paper is an historical\nreview of the 1918 pandemic (the\ncomparison of Philadelphia and\nSt. Louis is emblematic of the\nlesson from 1918 that timing\nmatters when deploying NPls-\nneed to be early) . The second\npaper is modeling work that was\ndone to evaluate these strategies.\nAt the time, modelers were\nfocused on how best to contain an\noutbreak overseas (really focusing\non using antivirals primarily for\ntreatment and prophylaxis). They\nfocused their models to evaluate\nthe effectiveness of various\nstrategies and quantities of\nantiviral medications required to\nquench an emerging outbreak .\nThere were 3 groups who were\ndoing this work back then. They\neach present their data in that\npaper . A few things to note. In all\nthe model runs, they did not model\nperfection or 100% adherence\n(actually far from it). You will see\nscenarios from 30/60 (meaning\n30% compliance and 60%\nascertainment) on up to 90/80 ).\n(See figures 1) Even leaky\nimplementation can reduce overall\nNIH-001574\nattack rates. The modelers also\nlooked at timing of\nimplementation (see figure 3). At\nthe time there was a great deal of\nskepticism-was hard for people\nto believe this was possible . Or\neven if TLC could be effective,\nwas implementation practical\ngiven the challenges trying to\nnd\nimplement and the 2 and 3       rd\norder consequences (especially of\nclosing schools). But the\nmodeling data combined with the\nhistolical data was the tipping\npoint. Marty Cetron from CDC\nand Howard Markel from U of\nMichigan, published a more\nextensive historical review of the\n1918 pandemic showing much the\nsame. Since then, a group within\nCDC continued to work on this\n(collecting additional data from\nthe 2009 pandemic and\nelsewhere). They published an\nupdate of CMG in MMWR in\n2017.\nhttps://protect2 .fireeye .com/ur l?k=\n3985fc87 -65d l e5fb-3985cdb8 -\n0cc4 7adc5 fa2-\nbb4a28 993 b5aa9e0& u=https://ww\nw .cdc.gov/media /dpk/cdc-24-\n7/preven ting-pandemic -\ninfluenza /community -mitigation -\nguidelines-for-preven ting-\npandem ic-flu.html\nThe third paper, is a more recent\npaper (from 201 7) that Richard\nshared with me. The paper is a\nlittle dense, but\nI found this paper useful because it\nprovides a vocabulary for\nstrategies that we have raised\n(Symptom Monitoling vs\nNIH-001575\nQuarantine of potentially infected\nbut symptom-free contacts during\nan epidemic). This paper\nidentifi es those conditions where\nSM or Q is preferred. Figure 1 is\nuseful for und erstanding the\nchallenges given the picture that\nseems to be emerging with this\nvirus. This outbreak seems closer\nto pandemic flu than SARS in\nterms of transmission dynamics\n(and hence the NPis we would\nneed to employ).\nLastly, another person, Bob Glass\nat Los Alamos, also did work on\nthis separately from the MIDAS\ngroup. He actually began this\nwork as pa1t of a science fair\nproject for his daughter (using\nsocial contacts of his daughter and\nher classmat es at school to model\ndisease transmission). He knew\nsomeone at VA who forwarded his\nwork to us (chain of\ntransmission). Early on (even\nbefore the MIDAS group modeled\nTLC), we had a \"Eureka\" moment\nwhen we graphed his data in Excel\n(I can share that single graph to\nanyone interested). Bob Glass was\nalso interested in trying to\ndetermine when you could let up\non the NPis during a pandemic.\nHere is a story about Bob Glas s\nand that work published in Fast\nCompany\nhttps: //protect2.fueeye. com/ur l?k=\n3862f880 -6436e l fc-3862c9 bf-\n0cc4 7adc5fa2-\n9ce5afJ 1e3c2cd6 4&u=https ://ww\nw .fastcompany .corn/3058542 /the-\nscientist s-who-simulate-the-end-\nof -the-world I will see if I can\nfind his work on when to reopen\nschools.

Staff\nworking in ERs and\nICUs are pretty\nfamiliar with the care\nof these types of\npatients and the use of\nappropriate PPE\n(standard contact and\nairborne precautions\nincluding eye\nprotection). The staff\nat the hospitals\nundergo fit test ing for\nrespirators, etc. Staff\nin outpatient clinics\n(especially remote\ncomm unity based\noutpatient clinics)\ndon't typically\nundergo fit testing for\nrespirators. So ERs\nand ICUs have\nmuscle memory for\nisolating patien ts and\nprov iding care to\npatients with\ninfectious respiratory\ndisease. Community\nbased outpatient\nclinics do not.\nAs part of the\npreparedness efforts,\nthere has been interest\nin fit testing\noutpatient clinic staff\nand supp lying these\nclinics with PPE and\nestablishing\nprocedures for\nNIH-001583\nevaluating COVID-19\npatients in the\ncommun ity based\nclinics. Given the\nprojected shortages of\nPPE, that just doesn't\nseem like the most\nprudent approach.\nRather than expand\nthe care of potential\nCOVID-19 patients to\ncommunity based\noutpat ient clinics, I\nwou ld focus on\nhospital care--ERs\nand inpatient areas\n(especially ICUs). I\nwould not pursue fit\ntesting for staff\nworking in outlying\nclinics. As a strategy,\nI suggested dividing\nCOVID patients into\ntwo categories-(1 )\nthose with illness that\nis mild enough to be\ncared for at home\n( self care or care by\nother family\nmembers); or (2)\nthose who are sick\nenough to be seen in\nthe ER for possible\nhosp italizat ion. I\nwould refocus the\nefforts of outlying\nclinics away from\nCOVID and toward\nkeeping non-COVID\npatients with the usual\nmix of acute and\nchro nic illnesses we\nsee from hypertension\nto CHF to diabetes,\nNIH-001584\netc., out of the ER and\nout of the hospital.\nThat is what they can\ndo to help unburden\nERs and hospitals for\nthe surge in COVID\npatients in ERs and\nhospitals. I would\nleverage telephone\ncare as much as\npossible to handle\npatients with mild\ndisease seeking care\nrelated to COVID\n(and quickly develop\nalgorithms to\ndetennine who has\nmild disease and can\nbe managed by\ntelephone at home\nand who needs to\nevaluated in the ER) .\nThink of it like the\nprogram Lisa\ndeveloped for\npandemic influenza\n(Nurse On Call) on\nsteroids , minus the\nantivira l piece. Could\nwe repurpose and\nleverage that program\nfor COVID? Such a\nstrategy would help to\nconse rve om PPE\nsupply (avo id the\nexpansion of fit\ntesting and the\nredirection of already\nlimited supplies of\nPPE to outlying\nclinics) and not ask\noutlying clinics to do\nsomething they don't\ntypically do (that\nusually doesn't out\nturn out very well). If\nNIH-001585\nthe outlying clinics\nfocused on what they\nnormally do (caring\nfor patients with\nchronic diseases),\nthey could help the\nER and hospitals cope\nwith the demands of\nCOVID. I would\nthink about Urgent\nCare centers in the\nsame way- to help to\ndecompress ERs.\nI also think that we\nneed to start thinking\nabout strategies to\nconserve PPE for\nhospitals. I'm\nconcerned about the\nprojected burn rates\nand the supply chains\nfor PPE. Click on\nAmazon and check\nout the prices now.\nOr click on WalMart\n(can't pick up any\nmasks from Wa lMart\nnow). I saw one\nsupplier selling 200\nsurgica l masks on\nWalMaii's site for\nonly $459.99. Such a\ndeal.\nAs a conservation\nstrategy , we might\nthink about limiting\nthe amount of staff\ninteracting with\ninfected patients and\ncohorting patients\n(even thinking of\nstrateg ies to minimize\nneed for\nNIH-001586\nhousekeeping or food\nservice or lab services\nfrom enter ing areas\nwith COVID patients-\n-think Ebola-like\nstrateg ies (not out of\nconcern of disease\ntransmission but\nsimply to limit\nnumber of staff to\nconserve PPE).\nCould do something\nsimilar with ERs\n(akin to what\npediatricians do to\nseparate sick call\npatients from other\nappointments). I\nhave recommend\nprioritizing PPE for\nEDs and ICUs as well\nas specific inpatient\nareas where we would\nlikely initially cohort\npatients , not pursuing\nfit testing of\noutpatient clinic staff,\nand shifting patients\nwith mild COVID\ndisease to telephone\ncare and away from\noutpatient clinics.\nI know several of you\nare part of large\nhealthcare systems.\nAm curious how\nothers are\napproaching this\nchallenge.\nI am also resending\nthe questions I posed\nNIH-001587\nfor handling sick\nER/ho spital staff or\nstaff members with a\nconfinned case of\nCOVID in their\nhou seho ld.

While the quarantine potentially conferred a\nsignificant public health benefit in slowing transmission, CDC's assessment is that it may not\nhave been sufficient to prevent transmission among individuals on the ship. CDC believes the\nrate of new infections on board, especially among those witho ut symptoms , represents an\nongoing risk. Therefore, to protect the health of the American public, all passengers and crew of\nthe ship have been placed under travel restrictions, preventing them from returning to the United\nStates for at least 14 days after they had left the Diamond Princess.\nCurrently , there are more than 100 U.S. citizens still onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship\nor in hospitals in Japan. These citizens have been placed under the restrictions, as have the ship's\nother passenge rs and crew .\nAfter disembarkation from the Diamond Princess, these passengers and crew will be required to\nwait 14 days without having symptoms or a positive coronavirus test result before they are\npermitted to board flights to the United States.\nIf an individual from this cruise arrives in the United States before the 14-day period ends, they\nwill still be subject to a mandatory quarantine until they have completed the 14-day period with\nno symptoms or positive coronavirus test results.\nBecause of their high-risk exposure, there may be additional confirmed cases of COVID-19\namong the remaining passengers on board the Diamond Princess.\nCDC is committed to protecting the health and safety of all Americans. We continue to believe\nthat the risk of exposure to COVID-19 to the general public in the United States is currently\nlow. The U.S. Government is taking these measures to protect the Diamond Princess passengers\nand crew, their loved ones, the traveling public, and communities within the Un ited States.\n###\nU.S .

I'm wo rking on a story about the coronavirus response, aim ing to publish tomorrow. The\nstory is about how President Trump has praised China and President Xi, but that has made some of his\nadvisors uncomfortable given the lack of transparency from China and the inability to get CDCscientists\nin to the country. We also have some details about the response and the task force , and some\ndisagreements that have arisen. I've listed the points we have in the story that pertain to HHS- would\nyou be able to take a look, let me know if there are any issues and potentially provide a comment? I\nincluded some quotes from Sec. Azar's interviews on Friday with CNN and CNBCbut also happy to\ninclude a quote from the agency.\nNIH-001859\nI realize I'm sending this at the end of the day, so would it be possible for you to get back to me by 1 pm\ntomorrow? Let me know what works on your end. Thanks so much.\n• President Trump has lavished praise on China and its ruler, Xi Jinping, for its handling of the\ngrowing coronavirus outbreak - a posture some in his administration are growing increasingly\nuncomfortable with as his advisors remain concerned about China's transparency and handling\nof the epidemic .\n• Trump's praise towards Xi has irked some advisors, who say those comments and others about\nhow the virus wil l likely behave reflect how the president is being briefed, underscoring tensions\nwithin the admin istration over its handling of the outbreak and the message it should be\nsending to the American public.\n• Worries about the market and tenuous negotiations with China over a trade deal have played a\nlarge role in influencing Trump 's friendly posture .\n• Trump has told advisors he does not want the administration to do or say anything that would\nfurther spook the markets, but remains worried that any large-scale outbreak in the U.S. could\nhurt his reelection bid .\n• For weeks, the adm inistration's messaging was that the th reat to the American public remained\nlow and the virus was not spreading within communities. But some advisors pushed for a more\nbalanced message because they expect there to eventually be some commun ity spread as the\noutbreak grows, and the administration has since adjusted its message to reflect that.\n• In an effort to keep Trump calm and restrained, Azar has been briefing the president that\n\"everything is under control, totally under control,\" which has kept Trump from doing or saying\nanyth ing drastic.\n• HHSofficials have also told Trump that the number of infections could go down in the spring\nwhen it gets warmer, which is mainly an educated guess.\n• Some officials have complained that Trump's comments emanate from his briefings with Azar,\nwho they say has sought to control the response . He has told other doctors , including Anthony\nFauci, not to get too far into the details of the virus and outbreak with Trump . Instead, Azar has\ninstructed doctors to let him handle it.\n• Azar has also wanted to be the one to announce major updates about the administ ration's\nresponse to the virus . On Thursday, he briefed the Senate Finance Committee that the CDC\nwould use public health labs in five cities that normally test for infl uenza to also test for\ncoronavirus, taking state health officials by surprise.\n• Some officials said the response has become smoother and better coordinated in recent weeks.\nYasmeen Abutaleb\nThe Washington Post\nHealth policy reporter\n-----\no: 202-334-8387 c: ---~\n@yabutaleb7\n(b\n~)~(6)\n=\nNIH-001860","time":"2020-02-14T04:40:00","sender":868,"cc":[],"subject":"WaPo - fact check on coronavirus story"}],[{"recipients":[277],"body":"than 14 days, as global infections rise\nSou nd s good to me.

This first phase of clinica l testing will involve giving the vaccine to\nhealthy adults in the United States to see if it is safe and if it can induce an immune response in\nrecip ients .

Is th e CDC or NIH over seeing the distrib ution of th e live viru s in the U.S. ?\nThere is an interagency working group convened by the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and\nResponse oversee ing samples, and NIH and CDCare central to this . Virus is being deposited in BEi\nResources (a NIAID contract resource ) for characterization, growth and distrib ution. The WA isolate\nis available now and a Hong Kong isolate may be added soon.\n2. Will you be the sole sour ce of dist ribution in the U.S., or will institut ions be permitte d to obt ain it\ndirectly fr om other sources?\nAssuming appropriate permits are in place, there is no limitation on an institution obtaining samples\ndirectly from BEi or other sources. In a public health emergency, the U.S. government seeks to make\nisolates availab le under a Simple Letter Agreement that does not impose IP restrictions on\nacademics or developers (see attached language).\n3. If it can be obt ained from other sources, wh at sources will be perm itt ed? For exa mpl e, th e China\nor Hong Kong CDC or University of Hong Kong?\nAssuming appropriate permits and safety controls, there is no limitation on from where samples can\nbe obt ained . However, there may be intellectual property restrictions from some sources and your\ntechnology transfer office would need to negotiate if requested directly.\n4 . If you are to be th e sole sour ce, w hen would you expect to have a process for considering\nrequests?\nBEi resources already has a process for sharing in place and is currently sharing the vira l isolate\nobtained from the first Washington case. NIAID ant icipates t hat other viral isolates will be obtained\nsoon, and BEi is committed to making those available to t he scientif ic community as soon as\nNIH-001897\npossib le. We {NIAID/ USG) do not expect to be the only source, but will likely be one of the main\nsources for this research resource based on experience w ith Zika.\nS. If someone wishes to travel to China to work on the live virus, are there any travel restrictions other\nthan the self isolation/quarantine already in place (and of course subject to change over time)?\nFor that, contacting CDC directly would make sense. If you would like us to inquire, we can. For high\nconsequence viruses, use of proper PPEhas been a mitigating factor in quarantine consideration.\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have additional questions.\nThanks,\nAlan\nAlan Embry, Ph.D.\nChief, Respiratory Diseases Branch\nDivision of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, NIAID, NIH\n5601 Fishers Lane, Room 8E31\nRockville, MD 20892\n(b)(6)\n(b)(6)","time":"2020-02-13T10:18:00","sender":1133,"cc":[4,1135,1136,1137,82,81],"subject":"RE: Institutional request for information"},{"recipients":[228,1134],"body":"Linda:\nThere is a \"sample sharing\" working group involving NIH and CDC.

It is an opportunity to engage in the debate about the America tha t we\nwant to create fo r the 21st centu ry - and summon Americans of every politica l persuasion to a\nrigorous examination of the choices we must make together in the challenging years ahead .\nShowrunner is Emmy, Dupont and Murrow-winning producer Alyssa Litoff.\nABOUT MARGARET HOOVER\nMargaret Hoover is an American political commentator .

Pre -symptomatic influenza\ntransmission, surveillance, and school closings: implicat ions for novel\ninfluenza A (HlNl). Mathematical Modelling of Natural Ph enomena\n2010 ; 5:191-205.\nDear Tony,\nThank s for your JAMA piece on 2019-nCoV. Perh aps I can help in a\nsmall way:\nIn 2003, with SARS, the Ro was initially considered to be over 2, but in\nfact that was the conflation of the nosocomial and community rates. In the\n2004 paper , we showed that nosocomial rate was much higher, and that the\nRo in the commun ity was between 1 and 2. A lower Ro in the community\naccounts for why modera te public health action s could mo ve it toward\nextinction--and why it propagated in Beijing , but not Shanghai , in Toronto\nNIH-001957\nbut not in Vancouver--the Ro in North America became less than\none pretty quickly.\nTo me , one important aspect is the control of respiratory tran smission in\nthe hospital, avoiding extensive nebulization /aerosolization, or doing so in\nnegative pressure rooms , as for TB isolation.\n(Treating patient s with robot s is a good idea!)\nIn the communit y, standard public health quarantine, contact tracing should\nbe sufficient for staiie rs.\nAlthough hundreds of cases are reported in China, the actua l number of\ninfections is likely much higher. The 41 deaths are the tip of the iceberg of\nnot 800 infections (5% fatality rate), but maybe 8,000 infect ions (0.5%) .\nAlthough that rate is much better, if the mutating virus becomes very\ncontagious- then the impac t could be similar to 1918 flu. That's why\ncontainment is so important-and although draconia n, the Chinese\ngovernment is doing the right thing (as far as we know).\nWhen a new pathogen arrives, children often have mild disease but they\nare important vectors for transmi ssion in the cotrununity , reaching many\nhouseholds. The second paper is the imp01iance of closing school s to minimi ze\ntransmi ssion- This was for flu with a short (pre-symptomatic) incubation , but may\nbe even more relevant for 2019-nCo V. It is much too eai·ly to even think of this in\nthe USA , but it may come to this--and sooner will be better than later , when that\ntime point comes .\nHappy to help, any way that I can. Thank you for all you and NIAID are\ndoing!!!\nBest wishes , Marty\nNIH-001958\nMartin J.

We do not know for sure why th is is t he\ncase; however , many believe that the enclosed spaces in winter {mostly indoor\nbecause it is cold) allows better spread of a respiratory borne virus. Also, some\nviruses tend to thrive in cold, dry weather as opposed to warm, mo ist weather.\nRemember, however, that when it is summer here , it is winter in Australia and\nArgentina .

Curre ntly, there have been more\nthan 37,000 confirmed cases in China, and China has reported more than 800 deaths. As you\nknow, there have been three confirmed cases in Italy to date. The reported case fatality rate\n(lethality) among the 37,000 cases that have come to the attention of the health care system\nis 2%. However , given that there are likely many more cases that are without symptoms\nor with minimal symptoms, the actual death rate is probably lower than 2%.\nIt is impossible to predict how the virus will evolve. It is our hope that the extraordinary\ncontainment measures that China has implemented will help prevent the outbreak from\nbecoming a global pandemic. But given that the virus is present in 27 countr ies to date and can\nbe transmitted from person-to-person, it may take a footho ld and evolve into a global pandemic .\n2) What exactly do we know about its modes of transmission, especially from people who\ndo not yet have the symptoms?\nAgain, there is much that we do not know about the novel coronavirus, including its specific\ntransmission abilities. Based on initial findings that have been reported, we suspect its\ntransmission is similar to influenza and other respiratory viruses, namely that is transm itted\nthrough respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and by touching\nsurfaces, such as door handles, that recently have virus on them and then touching your face.\nThere have also been reports that the virus is present in feces and vomit. However, it is still\nuncertain that the virus can be transmitted through this route.\nTraditionally, most viruses are transmitted when someone has symptoms. With the novel\ncoronavirus; however, there appears to be asymptomatic transmission occurring. We do not\nknow how many cases are being driven by asym ptomatic transmission or by those with\nsymptoms . Typically, viruses are largely transmitted by infected peop le experiencing symptoms.\n3) Are the genetic sequences provided by China enough to start working on a vaccine?\nThe genet ic sequences provided by Chin a enabled researchers to quickly deve lop a diagnostic\nthat is being used to dete1mine whether someone is infected with the novel coronavirus. The\ngenetic information has also been useful in work to develop a preventive vaccine. The National\nInst itute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, is\nbuilding on its experience with the SARS and MERS corona viruses to better understand the virus\nas well as develop and test rapid point-of-care diagnostics , vaccines and treatments, including\nbroad-spectrum antivirals and antibody therapies. In terms of vaccines specifically , we are\nNIH-002040\nworking with the biotechnolog y company Moderna and the Coalition for Epidemic Prep aredness\nInnovation (CEPI) to develop a \"messenger RNA\" vacci ne for the novel coronav irus. Other\ncountries and companies are working to develop a vaccine as well.\n4) What are the technical times to develop a working vaccine in terms of scientific research,\nand what are the approx times for the necessary legal certifications, and for industrial\nproduction and distribution?\nIn terms of our work with Moderna and CEPI to develop a vaccine , we anticipate having an\nexperimental vaccine ready for Phase 1 clinical trials within 2 to 3 months. This Phase 1 clinical\ntrial will involve administering the vaccine to a sma ll number of healthy adults in the United\nStates to see if it is safe and has some ability to induce an immun e response. If that is successful\nand the outbreak has not ended, we will move to a larger Phase 2 clinical trial with the\nexpectation of proving the efficacy (or not) of the vaccine within 1 to 1.5 years. If\nefficacious, it will still take additional months to produce enough vaccine to distribute\nwidely ..\nIn addition to this vaccine, NIAID is also supporting scientists and companies to develop other\nvaccine candidates.\n5) 2019-nCov is the third Coronavirus aggressive for humans that has appeared in the East\nin the last 20 years and in 2009 the virus responsible for the flu pandemic too did come\nfrom China: what sort of preventive measures could be practicable to reduce the risk of\nrepetition of these events?\nTo clarify, the 2009 HlNl influenza virus was first reported in Mexico, not China.\nViruses affecting humans have occurred throughout history, from the Bubonic Plague to the\n1918 flu. We cannot predict what emerging infectious diseases will occur nor prevent the\nunknown from occurring in the first place. What we can do is learn as much as we can about\nemerging viruses, so that we can rapidly develop safe and effective point-of-care diagnostics,\ntreatments and vaccines to protect against infection.\nNIH-002041","time":"2020-02-07T02:02:00","sender":160,"cc":[35,4,79],"subject":"FORASF REVIEW:Draft responses to questi ons from It alian news agency"}],[{"recipients":[4],"body":"March 2, 2020 in Boston\nPlease RSVPno.","time":"2020-02-09T16:41:33+00:00","sender":0,"cc":[],"subject":"FW: Cowen Health Care Conference in Boston - China Pharma Market Panel -"},{"recipients":[0],"body":"Boston\nHi Dr. Fauci\nI am a pharmaceutical industry analyst at Cowen and Company, a New York City based\ninvestment company that specializes in health care.

The Report states that\n14 ,000 Chinese enter the U .S. daily. If the 5 airports receive 85% of these Chinese, then 2,1 00\nChinese enter the U .S. daily at other airports without enhanced screening.\n-- CDChas developed its own RT-PCRtest to detect 2019-nCoV in respiratory specimens. I have read\ncase reports where state laboratories have required too much proof of suspected Wuhan virus from\nclinicians before perfo rming RT-PCRtesting of specimens . CDC should provide their improved RT-PCR\ntest to all states and HHS should insure that all states have sufficient equipment and trained\npersonnel for rapid turn-around time.\nNIH-002 152\n-- CDChas grown the 2019-nCoV virus. CDC should expedite distribution of the grown virus to\nresearchers with verified credentials and vetting in a safe and monitored procedure.\n-- CDC recommends that persons suspected by clinicians of having 2019-nCoV be placed in a\nseparate room with a N95 face mask so that they are not in range of other patients. HCW\nshould wear personal protection: gloves, gown, face shield or N95 mask and goggles.\n-- Clinicians have identified 8 of the current 11 patients infected with 2019-nCoV in the U.S.\nCDC is doing a terrific job in getting the message out to clinicians and the public.\nSent from Outlook\nNIH-002153","time":"2020-02-05T07:50:00","sender":1197,"cc":[],"subject":"Dr. Levitt summarizes CDC 2019-nCoV Committee Report released today 5 Feb 2020"}],[{"recipients":[1199],"body":"Tak:\nThanks for the note .

Are you surprised by this\nresult? It's among the highest reading for this questio n since the Ebola outbreak in 2014 when\nthe percentage climbed to 59%.\n2. The U.S. is the only developed country in the top 10 list where most people think a major health\nepidemic will occur. Why do you think this is?\n3. A follow up question to t he previous one is how confident people are that their government\ncould protect them or respond effectively if such an outbreak was to occur. Over half globally\nsaid they were confident in their gov't's response. Do you think people have a lot of trust in\nthose in power to do the right thing in times of an outbreak?\n4. Seven of the top 10 countries where people had the most confidence in govts are in the\ndeveloped world . How important are developed healthcare systems when it comes to outbreaks\nlike the coronavirus?\n5. Likewise, many countries at the bottom of this list are emerging markets. What can govts in\nthese countries do to ease peop les' fears on how they are or will handle an outbreak like the\ncoronavirus?\nNIH-002 193\n6.

It is unfortunate that they did not interview the\npatient. Obviously, this changes the conclusion of the paper. My\n1\ncomment: \"There s no doubt after reading [the NEJM] paper that\nasymptomatic transmission is occurr ing\" was made because there has\nbeen a lot of discussion among Chinese investigators that\nasymptomatic infection is occurring in Wuhan City and Hubei Province,\nyet no publication came out and said this. Since th is was the first\npublication supposedly documenting this phenomenon, that is why I\nreferred to the paper and made my comment. It is unfortunate that\nthis error was published, but it still does not really change anything.\nRather than rely on rumors, this evening I telephoned one of my\ncol leagues in China who is a highly respected infectious diseases\nscientist and health official. He said that he is convinced that there is\nasymptomatic infection and that some asymptomatic people are\ntransmitting infection . The NEJM paper may be incorrect, but\naccording to reputable Chinese scientists , my statement is correct .\nHaving said that, I have been saying for some time that even if\nasymptomatic infection occurs, it is very unlikely to be a major driver of\nthe outbreak since most transmissions occur from someo ne who is\nasymptomatic.\nBest regards,\nTony\nNIH-002262","time":"2020-02-03T07:37:00","sender":1253,"cc":[35,79],"subject":"Re: coronavirus quick question"}],[{"recipients":[4],"body":"Set up a caLIfor me with Ed Henry\nAnthony S.

Remember\nthat for t he SARSoutbreak in 2002, bats infected palm civet cats who were sold in\nlive/wet markets and the civet cats spread the virus to human . Same for MERS-\nbats to camels to humans. You ask that there have been animal markets for a\nlong time, and so why now. The fact is that this is likely pure chance+/- more\ninteractions in the human-animal interface . Animal viruses mutate and most of\nthe time the mutations have no significant impact on virus transmission to\nhumans . Sometimes they mutate and allow single \"dead end\" transmissions to\nindividual humans with no efficiency in going human to human and so we get\nindividual infections and no outbreak as we have seen with HSNl and H7N9\ninfluenzas that jump from chickens to humans but do not go from human to\nhuman. And then rarely, animal viruses mutate and the mutat ion allows them\nnot only to jump species t o humans, but to also efficiently spread from human to\nhuman . That is what we saw in SARSand now we see this with 2019-nCoV, which\nseems to have adapted itself very well to human to human transmission, as per\nwhat is happening in China.\nI hope that this is helpful.\nBest regards,\nTony\nAnthony S.

But those may be of\nlimited benefit in the event the virus is being transmitted via\nthe fecal-oral route, said John Nicholls, a clinical professor\nof pathology at the University of Hong Kong.\nSquat latrines, common in China, lacking covers and hands\nthat aren't washed thoroughly with soap and water after visiting\nthe bathroom could be a source of virus t ransmission, said\nNicholls, who was part of the research team t hat isolated and\ncharacterized the SARSvirus.\nA virus-laden aerosol plume emanating from a SARSpatient\nwith diarrhea was implicated in possibly hundreds of cases at\nHong Kong's Amoy Gardens housing complex in 2003. That led the\ncity's researchers to understand the importance of the virus's\nspread through the gastrointestinal tract, and to recognize both\nthe limitation of face masks and importance of cleanliness and\nhygiene, Nicholls said in an interview.\n\"I think in Wuhan, that would be a very likely place where\nyou might get the transmission\" from fecal material , he said.\n\"If it's using the same receptor as for SARS,I can't see why it\nshouldn't be replicating in the gut.\"\nNicholls and colleagues at the University of Hong Kong are\ntesting laboratory models of human tissues and specimens to\nunderstand where and how the Wuhan virus replicates, he said.\nEmerging Evidence\nDoctors have reported diarrhea infrequently in 2019-nCoV\npatientsadmitted to Wuhan hospitals , though it's been more\nprominent among reported cases outside the city, including\nmembers of a Shenzhen family infected in Wuhan, and more\nrecently in the first U.S. case in Washington state . That\npatient exper ienced a two -day bout of diarrhea from which a\nNIH-002371\nsample tested positive.\nThe lab in Washington didn't attempt to grow the virus from\nthat specimen, said Lindquist, the state epidemiologist,\n\"because it wasn't going to add anything to his care.\"\nMany of the emerging coronaviruses are so-called\npneumoenteric viruses, meaning they can replicate both in the\nrespiratory tract and the gastrointestinal system, said Ralph\nBarie, professor of microbiology and immunology at the Gillings\nSchool of Global Public Health at the University of North\nCarolina at Chapel Hill, who has studied coronaviruses for\ndecades.\nOverwhelmed by hundreds of severely sick pneumonia\npatients, doctors in Wuhan might not have focused on any gastric\nsigns, Barie said in a phone interview.\n'So Overwhelmed'\n\"The Chinese are so overwhelmed at the moment and trying to\ndo a combination of treating patients and dealing with t he scope\nof the outbreak, and then trying to get out papers that describe\nwhat's happening,\" he said.\nAny virus in stool is more likely to be present during the\nacute phase of an infection, occuring before hospitalized\npatients develop a life -threatening complication known as acute\nrespiratory distress syndrome, Barie said.\n\"I have also spent most of my time focusing on the\nrespiratory tract symptomology rather than the gut because of\nthe relationship between these different emerging viruses and\nacute respiratory distress syndrome,\" he said.\nZijian Feng, deputy director general of Chinese Center for\nDisease Control and Prevention, and colleagues released a report\nWednesday on the first 425 Wuhan cases, and noted that early\ninfections that didn't appear to display typical signs -- such\nas fever and viral pneumonia -- or had mild symptoms might have\nbeen missed.\n\"The initial focus of case detection was on patients with\npneumonia, but we now understand that some patients can present\nwith gastrointestinal symptoms,\" Feng and co-authors said in\ntheir report, which was published in the New England Journal of\nMedicine.\nEmerging evidence of virus-containing diarrhea warrants\nfurther investigation, said Peter Collignon, a professor of\nclinical medicine at the Australian National University Medical\nSchool in Canberra, who advises the Australian government on\ninfection control.\n\"This is something new,\" Collignon said in an interview.\n\"We presume it's respiratory droplets, but with SARSthere was\nevidence of other routes .

Please plan to\narrive around then, so that you can talk with Senator Lieberman and the other speakers\nbefore the event starts at 2:00 pm. Just ask the receptionist to direct you where to go.\nHere are the speakers:\n• Forme r Senator Joe Lieberman , co-chair, Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense\n• Dr. Julie Gerberding, Executive Vice President & Chief Patient Officer, Strategic\nCommunications, Global Public Policy and Population Health , Merck; former\nDirector, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n• Dr. Billy Karesh, ex officio , Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense ; Executive VP,\nEcoHealth Alliance\n• The Honorable Tim Morrison, Senior Fellow, Hudson Institute ; former Deputy\nAssistant to President Trump for National Security; former Special Assistant to\nthe President and Senior Director for Weapons of Mass Destruction and\nBiodefense\n• Mr. Eric Brown, Senior Fellow, Hudson Institute\nNIH-002391\n• Dr. Daniel S.

Then Senator Lieberman will make a short opening statement, and look to\nBilly to set the stage and talk about the zoonotic nature of the disease , associated\ndisease management considerations , etc., in about 5 minutes. The Senator will then ask\neach of the other speakers to say a few words from their perspectives . Afte r that,\nSenator Lieberman will ask some questions of the group, allowing you all to answer and\nconverse. All of this should take about 45 minutes. Then we will allow the audience to\nask questions .\nWe are planning for Senator Lieberman to moderate the discussion and take questions\nfrom the audience , but if for some reason he cannot do so, then Billy Karesh will.\nI hope you will be able to make it, Dan.

Yes, I saw th is ear lier today and both Eddie and myself are actually quoted in it . It's a\ngreat article, but the problem is that our phylogenetic analyses aren't able to answer whether the\nsequences are unusual at indivi dual residues, except if they are completely of f. On a phylogeneti c t ree\nthe virus looks totally normal and the close clustering with bats suggest that bats serve as the reservoir .\nThe unusual fea tures of the virus make up a really small part of the genome (<0.1%) so one has to look\nreally closely at all the sequences to see that some of the features (potentially) look engineered.\nWe have a good team lined up to look very critically at this, so w e should know much more at the end of\nthe weekend .
