Importance: High
Dear Dr. Fauci,
First let me say we are very grateful to everyone at NIH for working to contain the coronavirus,
especially your team at the NIAID. Your interviews are articulate and informative - they give Americans
some comfort and some concrete ways to t hink about protecting themselves and what to expect. It
must be a stressful ti me and we want you to know that we have confidence in our NIH and CDCto
contain it and to help stave it off globally as well.

On a happier note, I wanted to reach out and THANK YOU for all you do for our Down Syndrome
research through the transformative trans-NIH INCLUDEprogram. It is making a HUGE difference!!
