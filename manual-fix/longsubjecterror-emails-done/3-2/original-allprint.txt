Dear Dr. Fauci,
First let me say we are very grateful to everyone at NIH for working to contain the coronavirus,
especially your team at the NIAID. Your interviews are articulate and informative - they give Americans
some comfort and some concrete ways to t hink about protecting themselves and what to expect. It
must be a stressful ti me and we want you to know that we have confidence in our NIH and CDCto
contain it and to help stave it off globally as well.

On a happier note, I wanted to reach out and THANK YOU for all you do for our Down Syndrome
research through the transformative trans-NIH INCLUDEprogram. It is making a HUGE difference!!
th
To this end, I am writing today in hopes you will be able to join us on Wednesday, May 20 for our
AcceptAbili ty Gala at my head table. Attached is our save the date for the event . We are excited to have
Caroline Cardenas as our 2020 Ambassador, Rep Pete Stauber as our keynote                           (b)(6)
•--•        , and Reps Lucille Roybal-Allard and Jaime Herrera Beutler are Global's Quincy Jones
Exceptional Advocacy Awardees. We believe the gala will be quite lovely and meaningfu l to so many .
We do understand that attendance cannot be considered if the coronavirus situation worsens. However,
if things are look ing much better (touch wood) we wou ld be deeply honored if you and our friends from
NIAID could attend. Looking forward to hearing from you soon.
