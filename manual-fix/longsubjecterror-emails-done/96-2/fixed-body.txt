I just watched you this afternoon at the press conference. Over the years I have seen
you and wondered along with family members if                                    (b)(6l
Also I just wanted to say how professional you are and that I don't believe what #45 or
his administration have to say regarding the coronavirus but have 100% confidence in
what you say and do. Thank you for being the adult in the room.
I am very proud of you .
