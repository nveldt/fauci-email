Tony,
Ari is pestering me endlessly. What is your latest update and assessment on
coronavirus? I still am having a hard time seeing this as serious as everyone
else. Am I blind? Yes very transmissible but low mortality like flu in many
ways-the elderly , those with comorbidities, and total impact is likely to be
less than flu . Also travel restrictions are delaying but not stopping virus.
NIH-001360
Am I missing something big or small?
Thanks
