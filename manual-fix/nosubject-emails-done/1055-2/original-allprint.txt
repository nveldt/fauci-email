Good morning! I made contact and it's in the works! We even have them in our 20/20 spec ial tomorrow night!
Question: do you think you could go live with me from NIH or WH one day next week for our Noon Coro navirus
show? it 's live steamed so we have millions of viewers . We would take viewer questions (1 wo uld give you ahead of
tim e) and you woul d answer only those you want to.
I t's a half hour show , but we would do whatever amowlt of time your sched ule allows.
It would be so impactful for the average viewer.
